Instead of your code : [CODE] Try something like this : [CODE] If you can - improve yur code ( create CheckableFrameLayout as parent layout of your List Item ) . ListView keep BooleanSparseArray of checked positions ( you can get it with method getCheckedItemPositions()) . In code ( grepcode ) it set View checked or not by itself only if View is implementing Checkable . If create CheckableFrameLayout and sat as main parent , you do not have to handle these cases in the adapter .",

The onReceive method of my broadcastReceiver actually takes me to a new activity using an intent should i use this code and paste it in the onReceive of the bootReceiver ? or what exactly should I write in the bootReceiver ? I am very confused about this point because I have multiple alarms and I have given each one a unique requestCode . There is no separate entity \" Boot Receiver \" in Android . Boot receiver is just broadcast receiver which responds to intent with action android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED . I believe you will need to do couple of things : Create a class which will inherit from BroadcastReceiver Add it to Manifest and add info that it should handle android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED in onReceive code read all your alarms from persistent storage and set them again ( so , they will be set again after each reboot ) .

    "text": "I 'm attempting to build a nested relationship using Django Rest Framework 3.0 . I 've created my serializers and have attempted to override the create() function . My models are defined as follows : [CODE] As you 'll note , I can have multiple prices for my items . My serializers are defined as follows : [CODE] When I try and POST a new item : [CODE] I get the following error : [CODE] Presumably because the Price serializer has no idea what the ID of the new item is . I 've tried overriding this functionality in the create() function of my serializer , but it appears as though the serializer 's validation is being hit before I have the opportunity to create the item and associate it with the price . So - How do I create a new item , get the item ID , and then create each of the new prices ? The problem is that your PriceSerializer is looking for the item key because it is specified on the Price model . This is n't immediately obvious because you are using Meta.exclude instead of Meta.fields . [CODE] Is the same as writing [CODE] Which makes it very clear what your issue is . Because your item field on the model does not have [CODE] ( or [CODE] ) set , Django REST Framework automatically generates it as a PrimaryKeyRelatedField with [CODE] . This is why you are getting the This field is required is required error , because Django REST Framework cannot automatically detect that it is coming from a parent serializer which already has that field . You can get around this by removing the field from the serializer , as it does n't appear to ever be needed . [CODE] This will no longer display the item field though , but I suspect this is n't actually an issue for you .",

    "text": "Context In a C# Windows Forms application for Win7 we host an ActiveX control . So far , so good . Need : prevent ActiveX to receive mouse events Actually , the ActiveX has too much functionality . It is not very customizable to turn off features we do n't need . It would be nice if we just prevented it from receiving mouse events . The ideal would be to just treat events as if the ActiveX was not there , that is the mouse clicks go right through to the underlying ( or containing ) Control . But if we just prevent the ActiveX from getting events that would be okay with us . Search before you ask Some answers to previous questions mention to [CODE] , e.g . c# - Pass-through mouse events to parent control - Stack Overflow Other mentions to implement IMessageFilters , e.g . : winforms - C# Application-Wide Left Mouse Click Event - Stack Overflow winforms - Handling a click event anywhere inside a panel in C# - Stack Overflow winforms - C# Application-Wide Left Mouse Click Event - Stack Overflow Capturing Mouse Events from every component on C# WInForm - Stack Overflow Experiment : ActiveX still gets events I have fairly extensively tried both override WndProc and IMessageFilter ways , filtering ( opt-in and opt-out ) a number of events . In some cases I can prevent events to reach native C# controls , but the ActiveX still got its share . Filtering too much , prevented controls and ActiveX to paint , or even application to draw properly or caused crash on exit . This can be averted by selecting opt-in or opt-out options carefully . Is there another way ? Is there another way from C# /.NET to host an ActiveX Control while preventing it from getting mouse events ? Perhaps at application start time ?

    "text": "How can i use \" Plain C \" to program Arduino without using the \" Processing programming language \" ? I want to improve my C programming skills by using it with Arduino for embedded systems . I have very limited ability to code in C++ , and I would love to write my own Arduino Library using \" C \" , to avoid using classes and OOP . Processing looks like Java to me , and i want to use \" C pointers \" to gain more practical knowledge . The thing is that Arduino does n't use Processing . Processing is ( was ? ) a separate programming language which was developed independently for a different purpose . The language resembles C and C++ very closely , so closely that it 's almost identical . Programming the Arduino , however , is accomplished using a ( n unfortunate ) mixture of C and C++ , with a set of custom libraries ( which are similar in style to that of Processing ) . These libraries are written in C and C++ themselves , and they are only good for making one 's code more portable across different MCU types . Using them is not strictly necessary for programming the AVR MCU . In fact , the libraries have quite a few drawbacks ( the code is big , inherently slow and ugly , amongst others ) . If you want to use plain ol ' C for programming the Arduino , then just go ahead and do so . Grab the reference PDF from Atmel 's site for your particular MCU , learn the special registers ( I/O , timers , etc . ) , install the avr-gcc toolchain on your computer , and use [CODE] , [CODE] and [CODE] to compile and install your programs . There also happens to be a C-only library which follows this kind of convention . It does n't provide as much abstraction as the stock Arduino library has , because it 's lower-level , but you can have a look at it and see how one can accomplish basic algorithms without the default libraries .",

    "text": "I 'm writing an integration test where I will be inserting a number of objects into a database and then checking to make sure whether my method retrieves those objects . My connection to the database is through NHibernate ... and my usual method of creating such a test would be to do the following : [CODE] However , I 've recently found out about TransactionScope which apparently can be used for this very purpose .. . Some example code I 've found is as follows : [CODE] I believe that if I do n't include the line txScope.Complete() that the data inserted will be rolled back . But unfortunately I do n't understand how that is possible. . how does the txScope object keep a track of the deptAdapter and empAdapter objects and their transactions on the database . I feel like I 'm missing a bit of information here .. am I really able to replace my BeginTransaction() and RollbackTransaction() calls by surrounding my code using TransactionScope ? If not , how then does TransactionScope work to roll back transactions ? Essentially TransactionScope does n't track your Adapter 's , what it does is it tracks database connections . When you open a DB connection the connections will looks if there is an ambient transaction ( Transaction Scope ) and if so enlist with it . Caution if there are more the one connection to the same SQL server this will escalate to a Distribtued Transaction . What happens since you 're using a using block you are ensuring dispose will be called even if an exception occurs . So if dispose is called before txScope.Complete() the TransactionScope will tell the connections to rollback their transactions ( or the DTC ) . The TransactionScope class works with the Transaction class , which is thread-specific . When the TransactionScope is created , it checks to see if there is a Transaction for the thread ; if one exists then it uses that , otherwise , it creates a new one and pushes it onto the stack . If it uses an existing one , then it just increments a counter for releases ( since you have to call Dispose on it ) . On the last release , if the Transaction was not comitted , it rolls back all the work . As for why classes seem to magically know about transactions , that is left as an implementation detail for those classes that wish to work with this model . When you create your deptAdapter and emptAdapter instances , they check to see if there is a current transaction on the thread ( the static Current property on the Transaction class ) . If there is , then it registers itself with the Transaction , to take part in the commit/rollback sequence ( which Transaction controls , and might propogate to varying transaction coordinators , such as kernel , distributed , etc . ) .",

Is the pattern I 've implemented kosher ? I 'd like some feedback so I do n't keep heading in a bad direction , if that is indeed what I 'm doing .. . For example , Base Presenter : [CODE] I then subclass this into the following : PhotoRecyclerPresenter : [CODE] And it communicates with the view : PhotoRecyclerFragment : [CODE] This lets me define a set of requirements a view needs to conform to in order to utilize the singleton presenter , while keeping the presenter agnostic about what views use it , as long as they conform to its protocol . So far in my practice project it seems to work fine , but I ca n't seem to find any resources where what I 'm doing is recommended as far as MVP goes , and I have enough self-doubt that I figured I 'd ask my first StackOverflow question . Can anyone who has experience with MVP shed some light on this ? Also , if I 'm asking in the wrong place , feel free to point me to the correct place to post this . Thanks :)",

    "text": "I have the following code for a CUDA program : [CODE] in which every thread will print its threadIdx.x and blockIdx.x . One possible output of this program is this : [CODE] Running the program several times I get similar results , except that block order is random . For example , in the above output we have this block order 0 , 2 , 3 , 1 . Running the problem again I get 1 , 2 , 3 , 0 . This is expected . However , the thread order in every block is always 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 . Why is this happening ? I thought it would be random too . I tried to change my code to force thread 0 in every block to take longer to execute . I did it like this : [CODE] I would expect thread order to be 1 , 2 , 3 , 0 . However , I got a similar result to the one I have shown above where thread order was always 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 . Why is this happening ? [OUTPUT] With 4 threads per block you are only launching one warp per block . A warp is the unit of execution ( and scheduling , and resource assignment ) in CUDA , not a thread . Currently , a warp consists of 32 threads . This means that all 4 of your threads per block ( since there is no conditional behavior in this case ) are executing in lockstep . When they reach the printf function call , they all execute the call to that function in the same line of code , in lockstep . So the question becomes , in this situation , how does the CUDA runtime dispatch these \" simultaneous \" function calls ? The answer to that question is unspecified , but it is not \" random \" . Therefore it 's reasonable that the order of dispatch for operations within a warp does not change from run to run . If you launch enough threads to create multiple warps per block , and probably also include some other code to disperse and or \" randomize \" the behavior between warps , you should be able to see printf operations emanating from separate warps occurring in \" random \" order . To answer the second part of your question , when control flow diverges at the [CODE] statement , the threads where [CODE] simply wait to at the convergence point after the [CODE] statement . They do not go on to the printf statement until thread 0 has completed the [CODE] block .",

This happens a lot when getting started with [CODE] [CODE] ; it might be more common than real problems with concurrency . There are sections in the FAQ and the Go wiki about it . The anonymous [CODE] you create gets a reference to a variable in the outer scope , not to its value at the time the [CODE] statement runs . And that loop variable is updated each pass through the loop , so it changes between your [CODE] statement and when the goroutine actually runs . You can work around this by declaring another variable during each iteration of the loop ( i.e . , inside the [CODE] braces ) . If your loop was [CODE] [CODE] you could just add [CODE] . So , this bad version : [CODE] always ... prints 9 . A fixed version , redeclaring i inside the loop : [CODE] prints .. 0-9 . A different , arguably more elegant way to redeclare i is to make it a param of the anonymous [CODE] ; then it 's not a weird-looking standalone statement : [CODE] Here 's that code . For all of the Playground versions , I had to add synchronization so main would n't exit before the goroutines run . It 's confusing that a declaration that \" runs \" once each time through the loop behaves differently ( weird way for scope to manifest ) but the way to get around it is straightforward enough . In your case : [CODE] can run at any time , and it turns out to run after you 've gone through the [CODE] loop entirely . However , it uses whatever the value of new is as of when it actually runs , not as of when the go statement was executed . In this case , both the goroutines you start get the value 1001 , the so second time through both values passed into enqueue are odd ( you can see that as two [OUTPUT] in your output ) so nothing writes to the queue , so there is nothing for the [CODE] loop to consume . The channel is n't closed either , so the main ca n't just end , so you get a deadlock . You want a different value to be \" captured \" for each execution of the goroutine . For that , you can put [CODE] at the top of the loop , as funny as that looks . That 's enough to make the value from each iteration a \" different var \" from Go 's perspective , so you get 1000 and 1001 inserted in the channel . Once you 've actually got it working , the Playground wo n't actually run your code successfully because it loops forever and there are a zillion goroutines running and I guess the Playground does n't like that ( overusing resources ) . If you add a limit of 100 elements dequeued before quitting , you get http://play.golang.org/p/bBM3uTnvxi . You 'll also notice the numbers it outputs get weird because multiplying by 100 each time will eventually overflow the machine 's int type , but that 's just how it goes writing programs in lowish-level languages . As a minor thing , you probably do n't want to name a variable new because that 's also the name of a built-in function . It 's legal to do so , just confusing . ( It can be kind of reflexive to name a length variable len , especially if nothing was wrong with that in the language you 're coming from . )",

Can something similar be done with ring 's :init function without using a global var ? The \" correct \" way to do this is to use a dynamically bound var . You define a var with : [CODE] And then you create some ring middleware which binds the var for each handler call : [CODE] You would use this to inject dependencies by using this in your ' main ' function where you launch the server : [CODE] I 've seen this done a couple of ways .

You can create your array once , and then pass it to your location generation function which can alter the values stored in your array , and then to your render function . This will also reduce the memory use of your program . I may be misunderstanding the question , but why do n't you make a class with a function to generate and another function to edit the locations ? Your code for execution would then be : [CODE] Simply put , is separating the functions an issue ?",

If you do n't want to use a delegate , you can use a synchronous call with NSURLConnection , like this : [CODE] Just beware that this will not be running asynchronously . If you do n't want it to run on the main thread and block your main thread/UI , consider using a separate thread to execute that code or use GCD . You need to implement the delegate methods for NSURLConnection to be notified of incoming data . You are using the asynchronous methods .

How can I fix it without explicitly adding : [CODE] [CODE] [CODE] [CODE] [CODE] An explanation would be : Prototypes are live chains between objects . Because B 's prototype is a single tone instance of A , the array prop is passed by reference . This means that for each B instance we have access to the same A instance on the prototype . This might sound confusing at first but that 's the magic of prototypes in JavaScript . This is the caveat of prototypal inheritance . Anything on the prototype will be passed down to each instance . To maintain different instances of the attribute we initialise our object 's attributes in the constructor . When working with objects in JS ( like arrays ) , they are passed by reference . To make use of JS 's prototype system I would suggest something like so : [CODE] This way we reuse the methods from the \" parent \" and have a localised array in our \" child \" . At a first glance this might look as a classic OOP inheritance case but it is a bit different . If you want to read more about prototypes in JS I recommend this article Hope this helps .",

    "text": "Recently I 'm trying to create a ZSL session on my camera app using the camera2 API from android . I 'm using a device with a LEVEL-3 hardware level which supports [CODE] . In this case I 'm using the next template : All the tables and information can be found in the ReprocessableCaptureSession documentation With the table above , I created a ReprocessableCatureSession with the next values : Input configuration in YUV format with 4608 x 3456 Size ( The one returned by my CameraCharacteristics when calling getInputSizes(ImageFormat.YUV_420_888) YUV_420_888 ImageReader Surface with 4608 x 3456 size . JPEG ImageReader Surface with the size that I want ( With a maximum size of 4608x3456 ) . A Preview Surface in YUV Format . RAW ImageReader Surface with the max size of the application ( RAW always should be sensor device size ) . With this values I can create a ReprocessableCaptureSession an everything works well . I attached my YUV_420_888 Surface to my preview CaptureRequest to capture all the images from the preview in a custom class which works as a RingQueue of images and CaptureRequest where I store the last X images from my preview , ready to be taked and reprocessed in the way that I want(ZSL) . I can reprocess images from YUV to RAW , to JPEG , change values and everything , but my problem appear when I want to use the YUV images that I captured which are always at MAX SIZE(4608x3456) to generate a JPEG from them or process them with some native libraries which uses YUV bytearrays to work . In this case my image is always in the MAX Size , and I do n't want that . The documentation says that my \" Same as input \" Target ( YUV in this case ) size can go from minimum to MAXIMUM , it does n't indicate that it just work in the max size given by the hardware . It is possible to achieve these in some way ? I mean , I have tried to look to more codes which use Camera API 2 , but the documentation about ReprocessableCaptureRequest is a bit poor and the only code that I found on internet is the CTS repository from Google . My problem can be solved just finding a way to configure my Session with a lower YUV imageReader session or looking to some way to resize a YUV Byte[] to a different width and height values .

    "text": "I am a bit confused about the c++11 random library . What I understand : we need two separate concepts : random engine ( which can be pseudo ( need seed ) or real ) distribution : it maps the numbers obtained from the engine to a specific interval , using a specific distribution . What I do n't understand is why not just use this : [CODE] As far as I can tell this works well . Instead , this is what I found on most examples/sites/articles : [CODE] I am not talking about special use , e.g . cryptography , just your basic getting started articles . My suspicion is because std::mt19937 ( or std::default_random_engine ) accepts a seed , it can be easier to debug by providing the same seed during a debug session . Also , why not just : [CODE] [OUTPUT] It might be fine if you only will do this once , but if you will do it many times , it 's better to keep track of your std::random_device and not create / destroy it unnecessarily . It may be helpful to look at the libc++ source code for implementation of std::random_device , which is quite simple . It 's just a thin wrapper over std::fopen(\"/dev/urandom\") . So each time you create a std::random_device you are getting another filesystem handle , and pay all associated costs . On windows , as I understand , std::random_device represents some call to a microsoft crypto API , so you are going to be initializing and destroying some crypto library interface everytime you do this . It depends on your application , but for general purposes I would n't think of this overhead as always negligible . Sometimes it is , and then this is great . I guess this ties back into your first question : [OUTPUT] [CODE] At least the way I think about it is : std::mt19937 is a very simple and reliable random generator . The implementation is mandated by the standard , and at least in boost , it used the same code everywhere , derived from the original mt19937 paper . This code is very stable and it 's cross-platform . You can be pretty confident that initializing it , querying from it , etc . is going to compile to similar code on any platform that you compile it on , and that you will get similar performance . std::random_device by contrast is pretty opaque . You do n't really know exactly what it is , what it 's going to do , or how efficient it will be . You do n't even know if it can actually be acquired - - it might throw an exception when you attempt to create it . You know that it does n't require a seed . You 're not usually supposed to pull tons and tons of data from it , just use it to generate seeds . Sometimes , it acts as a nice interface to cryptographic APIs , but it 's not actually required to do that and sadly sometimes it does n't . It might correspond to /dev/random on unix , it might correspond to /dev/urandom/ . It might correspond to some MSVC crypto API ( visual studio ) , or it might just be a fixed constant ( mingw ) . If you cross-compile for some phone , who knows what it will do . ( And even when you do get /dev/random , you still have the problem that performance may not be consistent - - it may appear to work great , until the entropy pool runs out , and then it runs slow as a dog . ) The way I think about it is , std::random_device is supposed to be like an improved version of seeding with time(NULL) - - that 's a low bar , because time(NULL) is a pretty crappy seed all things considered . I usually use it where I would have used time(NULL) to generate a seed , back in the day . I do n't really consider it all that useful outside of that . This article is a good point to start . I 'm going to synthesize just few points : It Has Unknown Cost . [OUTPUT] For my personal experience I 've notified that std::random_device is usually slower than a simple Pseudo-randomic algorithm . That could be no true in general , but usually it does . That because it may involve physical devices , or other hardware than the simple CPU . It Might Actually Be Deterministic . [OUTPUT]",

    "text": "I have an app that will take a list of players and set them up so that you can go through and create a bracket dynamically . The number of players will change and the names as well . Instead of showing a whole bracket , my point will be to go in columns . I.e . instead of the left side of the arrow , it show the right side : My questions is how do I best draw this ? My initial thought is to do multiple layouts where I hard code textviews with custom drawables and lines for each column of 16/8/4/2 with just one border , but then I have to constantly change the layout setup . My second one would be to dynamically draw it on a canvas based on this answer here , but it did n't give a lot of ideas of implementations . My Questions : If I choose method 1 , will I be able to dynamically change the layout of my activity ? If I choose method 2 , how could I go about this ? I 'm still pretty new to android . As for question 1 , yes you can absolutely change the layout dynamically . You can create several layout files and do one of two things : The first , is you can use your activity 's setContentView(int) method to completely reset the activity 's layout to a new view . The second would be to identify the parent view of the bracket portion , cast it to a ViewGroup and use addView(View) and removeView(View) . As for question 2 , you could go about using a canvas , but it would be quite difficult to use only a canvas , but possibly a combination of a canvas and a set of text views could work . While this is n't directly answering your question , this tutorial is one I have used in the past , and gives you an excellent sense of how to work with the Canvas class in android .",

I also need solution to be optimal , because string of numbers can sum up to hundreds of thousands . Principle explained in theory would be good , but preferred languages are PHP or NodeJs if solution is given by programming language . Even MySQL solution would be nice , if possible . But solution by any language would be nice anyway . Extra notes numbers are all positive integers number values are between 1-10000 Here you go , in Python . This has linear complexity : [CODE] I 'm assuming there are no negative values in your list , and the list consists purely of integers separated by spaces . You should n't have any problems translating it into any other language . I hope the algorithm is self-explanatory , if not ask . Usage : [CODE] First we pass the string we want to search , then we use method to_array() so we can create the array from the string , then you need to choose which mode you want to use . It has 2 modes , soft search and hard search . you can choose which one to use in the find method , [CODE] , [CODE] mode , [CODE] mode ; The soft mode it is really simple , creates a new multidimensional array with keys as the strlen of the numbers ( method order()) , so if we are searching for a number 70 we do n't really wanna use the 3 digits or more , i mean ( 100 , 99999 etc .. . ) . Then it just minus the search value with the number and tries to search in the entire array with ( in_array ) if it has the result ; [CODE] The hard mode is just as the name states , we will loop through every number . [CODE] Of course we could really make a few more tweaks but from what i tested it gives good results . Feel free to ask if you have any questions .

I imagine it would be possible to recieve a secret from the existing server on successful authentication that we could match to one we have manually stored on couchdb server . However that does n't seem to be very secure . I have read the Authentication docs at couchdb but I 'm still confused . Any suggestions for an authentication system ? I think JWT authentication is what you 're looking for . There 's a plugin which can do this for you : https://github.com/dmunch/couch_jwt_auth ( The repository is a fork , implementing additional functionality to the original one plus is compatible with CouchDB 2.0 . ) Basically you send your username/password to the authentication server , which in turn gives you back a token ( the JWT ) . You can now authenticate to CouchDB using this token . CouchDB verifies the integrity of the token either by using a shared secret ( HS256 ) or by using the public key of the authentication server .",

    "text": "Synopsis I want to build a custom control which displays events in a calendar . Here is the draft : The Concept The bottom left box is vertically scrollable . The bottom right box scrollable in both directions . It 's possible to move the event views around . If they come near the bounds during dragging the view auto-scrolls in that direction . The scroll area is finite according to the earliest and latest event in a database or a certain maximum . But if the user continues scrolling the scroll area grows accordingly and collapses if the user scrolls back and did not create a new event . This \" July 2011 \" button at the bottom acts as scroller . If the user pulls it beyond the bounds of the scroll area , it grows accordingly . The month name in the header stays always at this position until the next month moves in , so it 's a long cell which spans over the day cells of the month with a floating caption . The header rows and columns are always visible . The Question Since I 'm only slightly familiar with the capabilities of Cappuccino or Cocoa 's control classes : Where can I make direct use of Cappuccino or Cocoa classes , where is it reasonable to subclass Cappuccino/Cocoa controls and where do I have to write custom controls from scratch ? Edit : My Thoughts I think its reasonable dividing the control with a SplitView with a vertical divider . I could use a TableView for the left header column in the left subview . And I could synchronize the vertical scrolling with what happens on the right side . But I 'm not so sure about the view on the right side . I thought about TableView but I would actually only need the cells as a background grid . Thus , I guess , it would be difficult to have two header rows and to implement the desired scrolling behavior . So the best way is probably to create a completely new custom view . But then again the question : Where is it reasonable to subclass Cappuccino resp . Cocoa controls and where do I have to write custom controls from scratch ? For the calendar view it looks sufficiently different from a table view that it might be easier to just write it from scratch . Perhaps start with a bare CPView and draw the background in its drawRect : method , then create a CPControl subclass for the events . In its drawRect render its borders and background , or use a CPBox with setBackgroundColor : . The text is best drawn with label subviews . React to mouseDown and so on to implement drag and drop , double click events and what else you might want . Then put the whole calendar view in a CPScrollView . Synchronise its vertical scrolling with the scroll view on the left - use a CPTableView there . Scrolling is fairly easy with a CPScrollView : just call scrollToPoint : on the content view . You will need to expand the content view size dynamically to allow ' infinite ' scrolling . Maybe simply always make the content view size the minimum of the size of its events and the current scroll position + X ( the X giving the user some distance to scroll before you have to resize again ) . In a nutshell , subclass CPView and CPControl - CPView when there is no interaction , and CPControl when there is .",

    "text": "Are modal windows/dialogs considered a good practice for websites ? One of the things that concerns me about using a modal window is that it is so much like a pop-up window and it could cause user frustration or cause users to simply close it because it 's intrusive . Do you know of any studies that talk about user preferences and use rates ? Are there any accessibility issues beyond having the a modal window link load the content in a new page when JavaScript is turned off ? Do you like sites or web apps that use modal windows ? Why or why not ? What are good and bad practices for implementing modal windows ? I know modals are probably most often used when displaying pictures or galleries , but what are some other practical use cases ? Do you use them on your site and what lead you to your decision ? From a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as , say , dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows . They usually have a more cohesive feel to the site than either of the two aforementioned method . Aside from pictures or media , I 've used modal dialogs to serve the same purpose as dialog boxes - to get the user to give some form of required input , or to acknowledge something before letting them interact with the site again . From a purely accessible standpoint , they are n't so great . They typically require JavaScript , and , because of the way that modals are managed with respect to the DOM , screen readers will not interpret them well . To combat this , it 's always a good idea to degrade gracefully - one suggestion is to take the content of the modal dialog and place it on a page . Whenever the modal dialog should appear , have the current page redirect to the ' modal page ' , get the user 's input , and return to the page it was on . Finally , as far as my personal opinions are concerned , I do n't mind modal windows . I think that , when used correctly , they provide a decent experience - if something has to get my attention , then I 'd rather it do so without redirecting me from the page , showing an ugly operating system themed dialog , or a pop-up ( which my browser will likely block , anyway ) . I guess , to sum it up , if I had to choose how I 'd like to be interrupted , then I 'd choose a modal dialog . It seems as though many confuse modal window with a layered panel . A dialog box can be a modal window and a pop-up is a modal window . A layered panel is not a window , but has the appearance of a pop-up or dialog box . It is modal in the sense that the underlying layers are unavailable . Modal window are popular on web sites because they are immune to pop-up blockers . Modal windows were designed to obtain information or user action that the underlying application requires to continue . Non-modal windows allow the user to switch back and forth between the window and the underlying application . A good use for a non-modal window might be screen help or a tutorial , where the user needs a reference tool and access to the underlying application . IMHO , modal windows were designed for a narrow specific purpose and are used inappropriately a lot of the time now . Just because you can do something does n't mean you should ! :-)",

I am targeting these buttons so far with a jQuery Dom selector [CODE] I posted on codepen also : http://codepen.io/marc313/pen/uphiv Please and thanks ! While you could bind to each button individually , as in Deryck 's answer , often times such practice leads to duplicate code . Its likely your actual use case is n't to log 3 different things to the console when 3 buttons are clicked . Particularly if these 3 buttons do similar actions or if they act on the same set of data , its often much more clean to do something like this : jQuery [CODE] Markup [CODE] Reference On calling .on() for event binding Each item in a set will have an [CODE] number and you can use that to identify them . jQuery : [CODE] The .eq() method means \" equals \" and refers to the index number for the selector you chose in [CODE] . If you want to do that systemically , you can put that into a [CODE] or [CODE] loop . Of course , you would replace eq(0) with whatever number you want to use to identify the button ( starting from 0 being the first element in the set , not greater than [CODE] .

Every row in the UITableView is supposed to have the grey button when the UITableView first loads , and then if a user taps a button then it switches to the red version of the button . For some reason , about 80% of the time when I load the view controller with this UITableView on my iPhone , the first 2 rows in the first section will not have a button . What 's weird is if I tap my finger where the button is supposed to be 2 things happen : The functionality attached to the button works and NSLogs in the console in xcode . The red button appears . So it 's like the grey button is there , it 's just invisible . This does n't work because if a user sees 2 rows without a button they are going to think something is broken or that they ca n't tap on that row . Also , if I scroll to the very bottom of my UITableView , and then scroll back up again , the invisible grey buttons will magically appear like they were there the whole time . Here are the first 3 method implementations that are involved in creating my UITableView : [CODE] And then here is my cellForRowAtIndexPath method implementation which does most of the work in creating the UITableView and which actually creates the UIButton settings for each row . The [CODE] statement really has 2 sets of nearly identical code , the only difference is one is for section 1 of the table view and the other is for section 2 : [CODE] I have not included the full method implementations that these 2 statements trigger because they only handle the functionality attached to each button , and most likely have nothing to do with this issue , but I will post them here anyways . These 2 statements can be found in the [CODE] for cellForRowAtIndexPath and handle the touch events for the 2 sections of the table view : [CODE] I see the pattern of trying to set up a custom UITableViewCell from within tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath : quite a lot . The trouble is that I believe it to be the wrong place to do it . If you 're really only using a built-in UITableViewCell , then it 's the right place ; for custom cells , it 's not . I 'd recommend making a UITableViewCell subclass with a \" setup \" method that takes an object and uses that object to set up the cell 's UI . For instance , take section 0 from your UITableView . I 'd do something like this : [CODE] This way , you can set up the cell 's layout as well as images for the button in IB , rather than code . This also makes the code a lot easier to read ( and re-read 6 months later ! ) . Also , unless the 2 cells ( section 0 and section 1) are really interchangeable , I 'd recommend two different subclasses of UITableViewCell to give you greater control , rather than trying to force one to act like the other or vice versa .

This button will then trigger a jpg or some kind of image on the clients side that says he is currently away and to also have it mute the presenter 's microphone ? Anyone have any ideas how this would be possible in FMIS 4 and AS3 ? Yes , this is do-able . There 's a bit of code to write . Here 's a break down : Client for presenter makes a NetConnection and then publishes a NetStream to FMS . When presenter hits away button : Presenter 's client sets microphone gain to 0 Presenter 's client uses NetStream.send() to send a message to all subscribing clients . The message is basically the name of a function and some arguments that all subscribing clients should execute . In this case , the function would display/hide the \" away \" image . then do the reverse when the presenter returns [ Edit ] Adding some code to clarify how to use NetStream.send() : The presenter code : [CODE] The subscriber code When creating the NetStream , use the client property so it knows where to find the function \" toggleAwayImageDisplay \" we specified above : [CODE]",

    "text": "I 've created a bash script to find dollar words . For those of you who do n't know , a dollar word is a word whose values of their letters add up to 100 when A is given a value of 1 , B is given a value of 2 , C is 3 , and all the way to Z is 26 . I am new to programming , so I 've created a very crude script that 'll do this kind of thing , but it 's not working as fast as I would expect . Something in my code is slowing it down , but I do n't know what . This is my code . [CODE] I can only speculate that it has something to do with the [CODE] loops , or with how it is constantly writing the value of $line to a file . I 've created a script before that adds numbers to generate the Fibonacci sequence , and it does it almost instantaneously . So my question is , what are some ways to help my code run more efficiently ? Apologies if this belongs on codereview . Any help is highly appreciated . Thanks Edit : Although I accepted Gordan Davisson 's Answer , the other ones are just as good if you want to do this . I 'd recommend reading everyone else 's answer before giving this a try . Also , as numerous users have pointed out , bash is not a good language to be using for this . Again , Thanks to everyone for your suggestions . As @thatotherguy pointed out in a comment , there are two big problems here . First , the way you 're reading lines from the file reads the entire file every line . That is , to read the first line you run [CODE] , which reads the entire file and prints only the first line ; then you run [CODE] , which reads the entire file again and prints only the second line ; etc . To fix this use a [CODE] read loop : [CODE] Note that if anything inside the loop tries to read from standard input , it 'll steal some of the input from Words.txt . In that case you can send the file over FD #3 instead of standard input with [CODE] . The second problem is this bit : [CODE] which .. creates 3 subprocesses ( [CODE] , [CODE] , and [CODE] ) , which is n't too bad except that this runs 26 times for each and every word in the file . Creating processes is expensive compared to most shell operations , so you should do your best to avoid it especially in loops that run many many times . Try this instead : [CODE] This works by replacing all characters that are n't ${letter[i]} with \"\" , then looking at the length of the resulting string . The parsing happens entirely in the shell process , so it should be much faster . Given : [CODE] ( i.e . , the 370,101 word file linked HERE ) In Bash alone , start with a loop that reads the file line by line : [CODE] To count the lines alone in Bash ( same file ) takes over 7.8 seconds on my computer . [CODE] in comparison executes in microseconds . So the Bash version is going to take a while . Once you have the file word by word , you can read each word character by character and find the index of that character in a string of the alphabet : [CODE] Prints : [CODE] That takes about 1:55 on the 370,101 word file . As a comparison , consider the same function in Python : [CODE] Far easier to understand and executes in 580 ms . Bash is great for gluing together different tools . Is is not that great at large processing tasks . Use awk perl python ruby etc for larger tasks . Easier to write , read , understand and faster .",

    "text": "Can someone explain me why this is happening ? Silverlight 4 application using WCF Ria Services SL app calls StartLongOperation [CODE] operation . Due to synchronization issues with external components there is a Thread.Sleep ( 30 * 1000 ) in the server-side code . SL app calls GetStatus ( standard query ) operation . These calls appear to be blocked server-side and are waiting for the StartLongOperation to complete . Why ? ? I was assuming that serverside , the StartLongOperation runs an a worker thread and each call to GetStatus would run on a seperate worker thread . Client-side the calls are async so SL fires off the StartLongOperation and then continues to poll the GetStatus . But the GetStatusCompleted does n't get fired until the StartLongOperation has completed . Since all Silverlight network communication happens on the UI thread , only one WCF call can happen at a time . Meaning your StartLongOperation has to complete , and then the client will start the GetStatus call . If you want to test this behavior , fire up Fiddler . You will find that Silverlight will not send an HTTP request to the GetStatus method until it first gets a StartLongOperation response from the server . So the problem is n't server-side . It 's a limitation of Silverlight .",

Should i have same controller on the other app ? How can i connect and send http request and receive response ? Thanks in advance For such a simple example , you can do something as simple as : [CODE] However , you 're most likely going to want to deal with more complicated JSON responses , so before long you 'll probably want to use something like the Jbuilder gem or ActiveModel Serializers ( my preferred approach ) . On the other end , your front-end will need to make an HTTP GET request . Lots of ways ( and gems ) to do this , but one common approach is just to use the built in Net::HTTP class . [CODE] In your situation , a better approach might be to use the Active Resource gem . This gem allows you to create models that are backed by a REST API rather than a database . For example , if your API app provides basic Create-Read-Update-Destroy actions for a particular model ( let 's call it Widget ) at the following URLs : [CODE] then in your front-end app you could declare an Active Resource like this : [CODE] which will auto-magically access all of those methods in your API , and behave much like a regular Active Record model . That way , you basically design your front-end app like a \" normal \" rails app , but using ActiveResource-based models in place of ActiveRecord . I would note , however , that a more common thing to do these days would be to build your API in Rails , and build your front-end with client-side Javascript , using something like JQuery or Angular to make requests from the API . I 'm not sure what you 're gaining by splitting API and front-end , where both of them are Rails apps - unless you 've got a compelling reason , I 'd just build one Rails app that handles both API and front-end , or build a Rails API + Angular ( or similar ) front-end .",

In addition , since the priority of the phase figure is not of alphabetical order , adequate replacements are done . The core idea is taken from this answer and is credited to Aacini . Similar code to the one posted by aschipfl . Same value padding approach for each segment , just a different handling of name splitting and value padding . [CODE]",

    "text": "I stumbled upon an interesting behavior in the Trackbar Winforms control . On a horizontal trackbar , the left/right arrow keys work as expected . ( Left arrow moves the slider to the left and decreases the value , right arrow does the opposite ) It is also possible to manipulate the slider using the up/down arrow keys and PageUp/PageDown . However , the behavior seem counter-intuitive : arrow up and page up move the slider to the left and consequently decrease the value . Arrow down and page down move the slider to the right and increase the value . When using a vertical trackbar , up/down keys work as expected but arrow left = increase and arrow right = decrease . This is the default behavior in C# Winforms , and apparently in native Windows . ( Not sure about the latter , the slider for UAC does work this way ) In WPF the slider control works \" properly \" i.e . the value increases with arrow up , arrow right und PgUp . Also the slider in Internet Explorer Privacy settings works properly . Not sure why , but I suspect a custom handling of the keys . From an ergonomics standpoint , it is clear that up , right , forward and clockwise manipulation of anything is supposed to increase the value . ( This nothing new , compare A Guide to Human Factors and Ergonomics , Second Edition Page 100 ) Now to my Question : Does anyone know why this is the way it is ? I 'm strongly inclined to think this behavior was chosen to keep the trackbar control consistent with the scrollbar control . These two controls have very much in common ( their thumb can be moved by \" line \" or \" page \" increments , both controls can be laid out horizontally or vertically , both use WM_HSCROLL and WM_VSCROLL to notify their parent when the thumb position changes ) . From the control 's point of view , the thumb can move \" up \" or \" down \" ( \" left \" or \" right \" respectively ) . The keyboard navigation for scrollbars used Left and Up for upwards ( leftwards ) movement , as well as Right and Down for downwards ( rightwards ) movement . It must have made sense for the trackbar control to follow the same conventions , so developers used to the scrollbar control 's implementation could apply the same principles to the trackbar control .",

    "text": "I 'm experimenting with OrientDB and I would like to model a non disjunctive inheritance . For example : - there are Person - a Student is a Person - a Worker is a Person - \" Alberto \" is both a Student and Worker . Is it possible to model this situation with only the three classes I defined ( Student , Worker , Person ) or shall I introduce a new class WorkingStudent , extending both Worker and Student , containing \" Alberto \" ? I suppose a vertex cannot be instance of more than one class since the system would not know in which cluster to put it but I have n't found an explicit answer to my question , yet . Cheers , Alberto ( the working student :-) ) I think you may trying to solve this the wrong way . For instance , Alberto will presumably always be a Person . But when Alberto graduates , he will no longer be a Student . In fact , he might also lose his job and no longer be a Worker . Moving him from one class to another is a considerable issue . I 'd create separate , smaller nodes of Worker and Student . Then create edges from Person to Worker , or Person to Student . The edge can be named \" Is A \" . Now , it is very easy to add new categories , for instance \" Parent \" or \" Spouse \" , without having to worry about changing your class inheritance .

The first getline() is called in the userStringPrompt() function : [CODE] That sets a string that the program will use later to perform functions , like count its consonants , its vowels , etc . The second input is used in the menu selection ( choose what function/method to perform on the above string ) : [CODE] This takes in a user input : A , B , C , D , E and performs an action . For example , if a user inputs into the first input stream : [OUTPUT] and then enter \" A \" in the second input stream , it should count the vowels in hello , then return the number from the calculation , e.g . 2 The issue : The program functions correctly when the input in userStringPrompt is without spaces .

The entire code : [CODE] Any guidance/hints would be greatly appreciated . I 'm absolutely confused . I guess your program is not crushing , it 's just normally exits .

    "text": "The question I want to ask is thus : Is casting down the inheritance tree ( ie . towards a more specialiased class ) from inside an abstract class excusable , or even a good thing , or is it always a poor choice with better options available ? Now , the example of why I think it can be used for good . I recently implemented Bencoding from the BitTorrent protocol in C# . A simple enough problem , how to represent the data . I chose to do it this way , We have an abstract BItem class , which provides some basic functionality , including the [CODE] that is used to decode a Bencoded string into the necessary structure . There are also four derived classes , BString , BInteger , BList and BDictionary , representing the four different data types that be encoded . Now , here is the tricky part . BList and BDictionary have this[int] and this[string] accessors respectively to allow access to the array-like qualities of these data types . The potentially horrific part is coming now : [CODE] Well , you get the picture .. . Ouch , that 's hard on the eyes , not to mention the brain . So , I introduced something extra into the abstract class : [CODE] Now we could rewrite that old code as : [CODE] Wow , hey presto , MUCH more readable code . But did I just sell part of my soul for implying knowledge of subclasses into the abstract class ? EDIT : In response to some of the answers coming in , you 're completely off track for this particular question since the structure is variable , for instance my example of torrent[\"info\"][\"files\"][0][\"length\"] is valid , but so is torrent[\"announce-list\"][0][0] , and both would be in 90% of torrent files out there . Generics is n't the way to go , with this problem atleast :( . Have a click through to the spec I linked , it 's only 4 small dot-points large . The way I see it , not all BItems are collections , thus not all BItems have indexers , so the indexer should n't be in BItem . I would derive another abstract class from BItem , let 's name it BCollection , and put the indexers there , something like : [CODE] and make BList and BDictionary inherit from BCollection . Or you could go the extra mile and make BCollection a generic class . You really should not access any derived classes from the base class as it pretty much breaks the idea of OOP . Readibility certainly goes a long way , but I would n't trade it for reusability . Consider the case when you 'll need to add another subclass - you 'll also need to update the base class accordingly .",

I 'm stumped , and it seems my ability to find the answer on Google is failing me utterly .. . and since I just signed up here , I figured I 'd see if anyone here knew . =) Oh , let me try that ! I did n't realize you could remotely connect to another registry . ( EDIT : I was wrong , it did work .. . it just took several minutes to respond to my request to change permissions remotely ) The remote connection idea did it ! You 're good ! Thanks so much for your help ! I never realized you could remote connect with RegEdit .. . you learn something new every day , they say ! =) Thanks again for your assistance ! =) On another note though , about copying the XP version of RegEdit to Windows 2000 .. . is that safe ? I figured they would be coded in such a way as to be incompatible .. . but I could be assuming too much . =) If your having touble with RegEdit in Windows 2000 you can try the following : Copy the Windows XP RegEdt32.exe to the Windows 2000 Machine Using a Windows XP Machine , connect to the Windows 2000 registry remotely : File > Connect Network Registry",

    "text": "I am using the following code for uploading picture from android avd . [CODE] but this code adds few extra header info into the file . like following --* [CODE] test --* [CODE] param --* [CODE] \" Content-Type : image/jpeg therefore when the file stored into the server , it can not be opened as JPEG Image . I have found that the options object is responsible for adding those extra header info . i tried without the options object by assigning null . but still there are few extra info into the file . Looking forward for suggestions to upload file without any extra info within the file . Well if you take out these lines : [CODE] you wo n't see : [CODE] anymore . However you will still see : [CODE] as the web server needs to know how to handle the incoming file . I believe the problem to be on the web server end i.e . the script that receives the file . try [CODE]",
