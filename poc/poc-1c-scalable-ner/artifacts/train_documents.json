    "text": "If we override parent class 's method , we can use super() to avoid mention of parent class 's name - that 's clear . But what about case , when we just use in subclass some function defined in parent class ? What is preferable way : to use super().parent_method() or self.parent_method() ? Or there 's no difference ? [CODE] [OUTPUT] actually super() is not syntactic sugar , its purpose is to invoke parent implementation of a certain method . You have to use super() when you want to override a parent method , you do n't have to use super() when instead you want to overwrite a method . The difference is that in the first case you want to add extra behavior ( aka code execution ) before or after the original implementation , in the second you want a completely different implementation . You ca n't use self.method_name() in an override , the result will be a recursion error ! ( RuntimeError : maximum recursion depth exceeded ) Example : [CODE] Given a base class A , with a method m , B extends A by overriding m , C extends A by overwriting m , and D generates an error ! EDIT : I just realized that you actually have 2 different methods ( test_a and test_b ) . My answer is still valid , but regarding your specific scenario : you should use self.test_a() unless you override/overwrite that method in your class B and you want to execute the original implementation. . so we can say that calling super().test_a() or self.test_a() it 's the same given that you 'll never override/overwrite the original test_a() in your subclasses. . however is a nonsense to use super() if not for an override/overwrite Usually you will want to use self.test_a() to call an inherited method . However , in some rare situations you might want to use super().test_a() even though it seems to do the same thing . They 're not equivalent , even though they have the same behavior in your example . To explore the differences , lets make two versions of your B class , one with each kind of call , then make two C classes that further extend the B classes and override test_a : [CODE] When you call the test_b() method on C1 and C2 instances you 'll get different results , even though B1 and B2 behave the same : [CODE] This is because the super() call in B2.test_b tells Python that you want to skip the version of test_a in any more derived class and always call an implementation from a parent class . ( Actually , I suppose it could be a sibling class in a multiple inheritance situation , but that 's getting even more obscure . ) Like I said at the top , you usually want to allow a more-derived class like the Cs to override the behavior of the inherited methods you 're calling in your less-derived class . That means that most of the time using [CODE] is the way to go . You only need to use super when you 're doing something fancy .",

    "text": "I have been using haskell for a while now . I understand most/some of the concepts but I still do not understand , what exactly does haskells type system allow me to do that I cannot do in another statically typed language . I just intuitively know that haskells type system is better in every imaginable way compared to the type system in C , C++ or java , but I ca n't explain it logically , primarily because of a lack of in depth knowledge about the differences in type systems between haskell and other statically typed languages . Could someone give me examples of how haskells type system is more helpful compared to a language with a static type system . Examples , that are terse and can be succinctly expressed would be nice . The Haskell type system has a number of features which all exist in other languages , but are rarely combined within a single , consistent language : it is a sound , static type system , meaning that a number of errors are guaranteed not to happen at runtime without needing runtime type checks ( this is also the case in Caml , SML and almost the case in Java , but not in , say , Lisp , Python , C , or C++ ) ; it peforms static type reconstruction , meaning that the programmer does n't need to write types unless he wants to , the compiler will reconstruct them on its own ( this is also the case in Caml and SML , but not in Java or C ) ; it supports impredicative polymorphism ( type variables ) , even at higher kinds ( unlike Caml and SML , or any other production-ready language known to me ) ; it has good support for overloading ( type classes ) ( unlike Caml and SML ) . Whether any of those make Haskell a better language is open to discussion \u2014 for example , while I happen to like type classes a lot , I know quite a few Caml programmers who strongly dislike overloading and prefer to use the module system . On the other hand , the Haskell type system lacks a few features that other languages support elegantly : it has no support for runtime dispatch ( unlike Java , Lisp , and Julia ) ; it has no support for existential types and GADTs ( these are both GHC extensions ) ; it has no support for dependent types ( unlike Coq , Agda and Idris ) . Again , whether any of these are desirable features in a general-purpose programming language is open to discussion . One major difference between Haskell 's type system and that of most OO languages is that the ability for a function to have side effects is represented by a data type ( a monad such as IO ) . This allows you to write pure functions that the compiler can verify are side-effect-free and referentially transparent , which generally means that they 're easier to understand and less prone to bugs . It 's possible to write side-effect-free code in other languages , but you do n't have the compiler 's help in doing so . Haskell makes you think more carefully about which parts of your program need to have side effects ( such as I/O or mutable variables ) and which parts should be pure . Also , although it 's not quite part of the type system itself , the fact that function definitions in Haskell are expressions ( rather than lists of statements ) means that more of the code is subject to type-checking . In languages like C++ and Java , it 's often possible to introduce logic errors by writing statements in the wrong order , since the compiler does n't have a way to determine that one statement must precede another . For example , you might have one line that modifies an object 's state , and another line that does something important based on that state , and it 's up to you to ensure that these things happen in the correct order . In Haskell , this kind of ordering dependency tends to be expressed through function composition \u2014 e.g . f ( g x ) means that g must run first \u2014 and the compiler can check the return type of g against the argument type of f to make sure you have n't composed them the wrong way .",

I only know \" classic \" sencha , but this should work the same way : So you could just add the mapPanel ( but hidden ) to your tabPanel , and in the button handler show it while hiding the button panel . Besides , speaking of layouts , I do n't think you need to precise layout : ' card ' in tabPanel since it uses a card layout by definition There 's several things you need to do to fix up that code : 1) ' Maps ' has no layout . Since it has a single child item , layout : ' fit ' would be appropriate here . 2) Only use fullscreen on the outermost item , you do n't want the other items to be fullscreen since they are child items of other containers . 3) To dynamically add items to a container , use the add() method on container . You 'll also need to call doLayout() to trigger a layout for the container . [CODE] However , in this case I do n't see why you 're adding the map to a panel , it does n't give you any extra functionality . Instead , I would add the map directly to the btnPanel . 4) The btnPanel has no layout either , so you 'll need to choose an appropriate layout there as well , possibly the vbox layout .",

Set multiple lambda consumers ( stream based ) reading from the same stream/shard ? Yes , no problem with this ! The number of shards does n't limit the number of consumers a stream can have .

Drupal . I would find out if your PHP framework requires e.g . Session auth with a CRLF token or OAuth or a similar scheme . Authentication will involve three steps : ** Sign in ** Retrieve a cookie or token ** Send the token in along with your content in your headers Finally you are going to need some sort of data encapsulation layer . I like JSON , some folks like XML . The GSON library , which you can learn more about here , https://google-gson.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gson/docs/javadocs/com/google/gson/Gson.html , is the most user and beginner friendly JSON library I know of .

I 'm wondering if there 's a faster way to do this . Particularly in O(NlogN) [CODE] If you know your max value for your numbers and can afford to keep a list of primes , then factoring them may be a better solution for the average/random case .

Approach : factor them and store a [CODE] + int closestNeigh[] take a factor and O(N) determine for each of them the closest that contain that factor ( prefix/sufix sums will be involved ) eliminate that factor from all the factor maps take the next factor . Adjust the closest neighbor index only if new one is closest . This may bring some \" relief \" on the line of [CODE] , but again if [CODE] ( all primes ) , then it is still O(N*N) If you are willing to get into factorization , one could traverse the list , once from the left , factoring each number , hashing the index of each new prime ( with the prime as the key ) , updating the index of each prime already seen , and , of course , noting the nearest seen prime .

Thanks Python code [CODE] Shell [CODE] Plus , the error below is the same code reported on my mac(Python3.4.1,OS10.9) [CODE] When you save the file in Notepad , the file is reencoded to be saved as your default file encoding for your Windows installation . Notepad auto-detected the encoding when it opened the file , however . Python opens file using that same system encoding , by default , which is why you can now open the file . Quoting the open() function documentation : [OUTPUT] You 'll have to explicitly specify the correct encoding for the file if you wanted to open it directly in Python : [CODE] I used ' utf-8-sig ' as an example here , as that is a file encoding that Notepad can auto-detect . It could well be that the encoding is UTF-16 or plain UTF-8 or any number of other encodings , however . If you think that the page is encoded with a specific ANSI codepage you still have to name the exact codepage . Your system is configured to use code page 936 ( GBK ) but that is not the correct encoding for this file . See the codecs module for a list of supported encodings .",

It really feels like it is defaulting to the standard German format . I have set the web.config globalization : [CODE] I am not using any resource files , so from what I understand the uiCulture does not come into play . The client is using jquery.globalize and correctly loading and using the de-CH culture . [CODE] reports the proper culture of ' de-CH ' on both machines . Locally it validates 100.00 as correct , but on the server it says that is not a number . All of this works properly on my local Win7 IIS7 instance . Though when we install it on the client Win8 server it does not work anymore . The client-side is validating numbers properly for the de-CH culture ' 0.00 ' , but the server rejects them as invalid . The Date formats ARE however working , which just adds to the confusion . This is where I wonder if it is somehow falling back to de-DE where the date formats are the same but the number format is ' 0 , 00 ' . Does a server have to have a specific culture enabled/installed ? Or any other ideas to check ? Finally we figured out the problem . Apparently there are registry settings for the culture on the server that were set to de-AT . These somehow were being honored above the Web.Config settings .",

    "text": "I need to somehow extract plain HTTP request message from a Request object in Scrapy ( so that I could , for example , copy/paste this request and run from Burp ) . So given a scrapy.http.Request object , I would like to get the corresponding request message , such as e.g . [CODE] Clearly I have all the information I need in the Request object , however trying to reconstruct the message manually is error-prone as I could miss some edge cases . My understanding is that Scrapy first converts this Request into Twisted object , which then writes headers and body into a TCP transport . So maybe there 's away to do something similar , but write to a string instead ? UPDATE I could use the following code to get HTTP 1.0 request message , which is based on http.py . Is there a way to do something similar with HTTP 1.1 requests / http11.py , which is what 's actually being sent ? I would obviously like to avoid duplicating code from Scrapy/Twisted frameworks as much as possible . [CODE] As scrapy is open source and also has plenty of extension points , this should be doable . The requests are finally assembled and sent out in scrapy/core/downloader/handlers/http11.py in ScrapyAgent.download_request ( https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/core/downloader/handlers/http11.py#L270 ) If you place your hook there you can dump the request type , request headers , and request body . To place your code there you can either try monkey patching ScrapyAgent.download_request or to subclass ScrapyAgent to do the request logging , then subclass HTTP11DownloadHandler to use your Scrapy Agent and then set HTTP11DownloadHandler as new DOWNLOAD_HANDLER for http / https requests in your project 's settings.py ( for details see : https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#download-handlers ) In my opinion this is the closest you can get to logging the requests going out without using a packet sniffer or a logging proxy ( which might be a bit overkill for your scenario ) .",

As noted in the comments : Once something has been sent to the browser ( or any other output ) , it is impossible to change it server-side . The best solution , if you are able to edit the contents of the header with preg_replace() etc , is to simply set the variable before including the header .

    "text": "This is a multi threaded scenario . The main thread handles the application and UI events , and it starts up a new thread to do some background operations . The \" background \" thread loads the data from files into a data-table of a strongly-typed dataset . The DataGridView is bound to that DataTable . Once the data is ready , the \" background \" thread invokes the refresh() function of the DataGridView on the form . If there are more lines then what fits on one screen and the vertical scrollbar is to appear : the grid crashes . The new datalines are always displayed . Error only occurs if there are enough lines to display the scrollbar ( see image below ) . I use .NET 3.5 . In Windows XP it crashes the whole application . On Win 7 ( 64 bit ) only the grid becomes unresponsive , but once I resize the window the scrollbar appears and all is fine . The relevant parts of the code are attached below . Grid refresh operation in the form 's .cs file : [CODE] The update part in the \" background \" thread : [CODE] The objects related to the \" background \" thread have a direct reference to the DataSet ( UiDataSource ) . The DataTable ( CurrentSamples ) is updated in the following manner : [CODE] DataGridView options : [CODE] If I made a mistake somewhere please point it out to me . @ChrisF : I tried removing the refresh() statement , as I am doing pretty much the same what u suggested . The only difference is the databinding , it looks like : [CODE] And I update the dataTable in a similar way , but from another thread . But the new data lines do not appear until I , say , resize the window . Which raises the question how I can properly update the dataTable from another thread ? I 'm guessing the problem has to do with how WinForms works inside the STA model for threading . Basically , the DataTable you 're accessing is located somewhere , and that is probably inside the form we see above . So , when you update the DataTable from another thread , which thread gets the events needed for binding ? Likely the thread you update it from , and the form 's thread is not aware of the changes being made . So , you simply need to invoke any calls to DataTable onto the form itself , so it receives the events properly : [CODE] It seems backwards , but keep in mind in an \" enterprise \" situation , you 'd probably be accessing that dataset by multiple adapters . So , your update thread would have an adapter to itself , and your GUI would have its own also . The other solution would be to use a BindingList , which I believe has thread compatibility for this type of situation , but do n't quote me on that . For extra credit , this could also explain your problem before with crashing . By accessing the DataGridView from the background thread , you had cross-thread operations going on . I would n't call : [CODE] These will take progressively longer and longer as the data set gets larger and larger . I 've written an application that uses a DataGridView to display mp3 file information . I set the DataSource of the DataGridView to a DataTable : [CODE] and then simply add the new information to the DataTable : [CODE] This automatically updates the DataGridView .",

In a shared spreadsheet to prevents any other user but myself from adding , deleting or updating a column you do n't need a script . When you say prevent them updating a column that implies you do n't want them to have write access . Either this is to a particular column or to any column . You can set protection to one of view only , comment only to ; the entire spreadsheet individual sheets or areas within a sheet If you do any of these they will not be able to delete the column either . Reading your code , the line ; [CODE] Implies you want to check if they have modified your sheet on a row basis . To prevent them inserting or deleting a row , create a blank column protect the column from editing hide the column If anyone tries to add or delete a row , this will span the hidden protected column and they will get an error message telling them this . Now the only onEdit(e) you will detect with be the editing of a cell or group of cells . Note that adding/deleting rows will not trigger onEdit() , they will trigger onChange() .

    "text": "I have a working code with a Datagrid as the main control . I used a Datagrid as it is very easy to bind data into it . My code requires moving cells into other columns so I always need to check which cell I am on when the mouse is clicked , as well as when it is released . My current implementation is working as expected . However , the way I check for the row and cell is through the VIEW 's code-behind . My project leader is looking for an alternative to have this done thru binding as he wants to keep the VIEW 's code-behind as clean as possible . I have tried all I could but I ca n't find properties which would give me both the cells column and row index . Please see the code below . ( Omitted some of the columns as it would exceed the limit . ) the XAML : [CODE] the code-behind [CODE] EDIT I proceeded to multibind the datagridcell 's column and datacontext properties as parameters for my command . An option I started before but set aside due to time constraints . Instead of looking for the datagridrow 's index , I used the datacontext to compare to my viewmodel . Did the trick . Alternative would be to work with properties DataGrid already provides to you and/or to define few other attached properties supporting you to get the job done . I would try to work with properties like SelectedItem , SelectedValue , CurrentItem , CurrentCell . Futhermore if a behavior couldnt be handled with those properties from above I would create an attached property and use a style for cells with triggers changing the attached property . Binding will transmit all the changes from the attached property to the ViewModel . In the end you will have just communication between ViewModel and View . Here are few links : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.datagrid%28v=vs.110%29.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.datagrid.currentitem%28v=vs.110%29.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.primitives.selector.selectedvalue%28v=vs.110%29.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.primitives.selector.selecteditem%28v=vs.110%29.aspx They should be all bindable Edit : Link to MSDN MultiBinding Page : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.multibinding%28v=vs.110%29.aspx The general way to achieve your requirement is to implement an ICommand type Attached Property for each event that you want to replace . The basic idea is this. . add an ICommand Attached Property with a PropertyChangedCallback handler . In this handler ( which will be called when an ICommand is data bound to this property ) , attach a handler to the event that you want to handle . Then , when that event is called , just execute the ICommand instance . So you can handle the event in your view model via the ICommand instance . Here is an example using the PreviewKeyDown event : [CODE]",

IT seems pretty simple set a cookie look for the cookie when the user visits the login page and if it exists log them in .

To test this I have the following code : [CODE] Now right after I set this cookie I can place a [CODE] and get the value of this cookie , however it does not show up in the browsers ( Chrome , FireFox ) cookie list . If I use plain PHP cookies , via setcookie() I can see the cookie but of course the Cake Cookie read does not work with those cookies . What should I look for to resolve this issue ? I did find a work around , but I do n't like it because it just bypasses the framework . I found out how cake is creating the cookies and for these cookies I use cakes cookie creation algorithm in my code and use setcookie() to do the setting . Just for anyone else that may want or need to use the work around : [CODE] Now you can use cakes cookie component to read the value . There is more you have to change if your value is an array , read through the cookie.php code to see what you would need to do .

Also , I get the below error in console after adding the overlays , I do not understand how I can use TiledImage.imageToViewportRectangle in such basic initialization of the plugin . [OUTPUT] . Codepen example URL : https://codepen.io/hussainb/pen/QQPPvL Codepen Code : html : [CODE] css : [CODE] Javascript : [CODE] Looks like this is a bug with OpenSeadragon ! Here 's the issue ticket : https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon/issues/1412 You can work around it by storing your overlays separately and adding them after the images have opened , something like so ( assuming you 've already created a viewer ) : [CODE] You can see this in action here : https://codepen.io/iangilman/pen/aqgzJZ",

Viktor Matplotlib \" snaps \" plot limits to \" whole \" ( factors of 2 , 5 , 10 , 100 , etc ) numbers , by default . This often means that your data may wind up on the boundary of the plot . ax.margins allows you to add a padding factor before this autoscaling for the plot is calculated .

    "text": "I want to share images to Instagram from my own iOS app and I am using Kingfisher throughout the project to download and cache images and show them in UIImageViews but this time I want to do something a little bit different . Basically , I am getting a response from an API with the url of an image and I want to Download the image to the library using the URL There is a bunch of questions on this for objective-C using [CODE] but I am using Swift . Rename it with .igo extension ( instagram exclusive ) Not sure how to go about this , would depend on number 1 . Then I could share it doing something like [CODE] or I could do it using the instagram hooks : [CODE] Documentation on this is scarce specially for Swift . How can I go about this ? a push in the right direction is all I need . In my navigation controller , I have a UIBarButtonItem set to System item \" Action \" . I then created the following IBAction code : [CODE] The excludedActivityTypes list is a complete/exhaustive list of available UIActivityTypes gleaned from code-complete or command-clicking on UIActivity type and going through the resulting struct . I uncomment those I wish to exclude - but leave them in for quick reference in the future . This will give you the popup you want . It sounds like you already know how to use Kingfisher and retrieving the UIImage from the URL .

    "text": "In our application we have a few GDI+ objects that are used often in many different contexts . This includes some instances of Font , SolidBrush ( White , Black. . ) , some Pen. . For those objects our strategy so far has been to hold them through widely visible static read-only fields . This avoids to create/dispose them millions of time . We took care of thread-safety accesses on these object of course ( they are just accessed from the UI thread basically ) . There are just a few of these GDI+ objects hold for the lifetime of the application , say like 200 . The others GDI+ objects ( the ones with short-life ) are all disposed asap . But we sometime get unexpected GDI+ resources outage exception , hopefully rarely enough . I am wondering if these exceptions could come from these few GDI+ objects hold , and if this would be a wiser strategy to create/dispose tons of short-life GDI+ objects instead . Does anybody have real-world experience and relevant conclusions about theses two strategies ? Caching System.Drawing objects is a mistake . They are very cheap to create , very expensive to keep around . They are allocated on a special heap that all processes on a desktop need to share . The heap size is limited to 65535 objects . Creating objects like a brush or a pen takes roughly a microsecond , miniscule compared to the cost of the operation you perform with them . The only drawing object that is expensive is a Font . Creating one involves a sizable chunk of overhead taken by the font mapper . But that 's already solved by .NET , it caches them . Other than hogging the heap needlessly , the programming style is dangerous . It is far too easy to forget blindly applying the using statement . This certainly can get you into trouble , you are relying on the finalizer thread to release them again . If a program involves lots of heavy painting but not enough object allocation to trigger a GC then you will exhaust the quota for GDI objects . Which is 10,000 objects for a process by default . This will crash your program . Do note that the System.Drawing class wrappers are not nearly big enough to trigger a GC by themselves , 10000 of them will not be enough to get the finalizers to run and release the handles again . The problem is very easy to diagnose , you can use Task Manager . Use View + Select Columns and tick \" GDI Objects \" . Might as well tick \" USER Objects \" , another one that 's very easily leaked . Keep an eye on the displayed counts for your process while you are using it . A steadily climbing number spells doom .",

    "text": "When designing my software , I began with interfaces since this seems to be the \" standard \" . Then I switched to abstract classes because they seem better suited to the problem at hand . However I 'm not sure if I 've missed out on some considerations when making this design choice . Other than domain specific issues which I have thought about what are the more general factors to consider when choosing between interfaces and abstracts classes ? If your interface also has reasonable default behavior for at least some of the functionality , you may want to use an abstract class to avoid common boilerplate code in all of the concrete implementations . Otherwise , use an interface . I find the best option most of the time is to do both . That is not always possible when you are relying on something happening in the base class . Providing both an abstract base class and an interface allows the greatest latitude by implementers of your abstraction , again , as long as you do n't require something happens by an implementer of the interface . If you require that something happens , then you do n't want to provide an interface at all--and you would also need to make sure that your base class ensures this required action to ALWAYS occur .. . Negative to doing both : more goo . example pseudocode : [CODE] Note that in this example , someone could make their own class that implements IVehicle and then pass it to anything that takes an IVehicle . That object would NOT need to be a child of the Vehicle abstract class . If , therefore , you were to expect something specific to happen in the PutCarInGear() method , it 's quite likely that that new class would NOT fulfill that expectation . However , as long as it never matters what implementations of IVehicle do , then it 's the most flexible abstraction to have both an abstract base class AND an interface .",

    "text": "As someone who is quite new to Swift and CoreData , I am sure I am going about this the wrong way and am hoping someone might be able to help . Background : I am downloading JSON over an API , and caching the content locally on an iPad in CoreData . As part of the process , I need to download a small image thumbnail , which I am also storing in CoreData ( as a Transformable ) . I was doing : My original implementation downloaded images and saved them to CoreData , but although it is being triggered from a background thread ( a callback following the API call ) , the actual downloading of the images seems to cause the app to hang : [CODE] What I am now doing : I have since updated my code to the following : [CODE] I then call the code thus : [CODE] Doing this , I do n't get any blocks on the main thread that I notice . Inspecting the sqlite file from the device , it looks as though the data is getting set properly , but the images are not showing up in the UI . Is my method completely wrong ? If not , how can I inform the UI that the core data model has been updated in such a way that will cause a refresh ? What function can be called to update a specific row/cell of a table/uicollectionview ? Your NSURLConnection 's callbacks are happening on the main queue . This is one reason your application is locking up . Your managed object context , at least in the code you have posted , is not following the Core Data concurrency rules . You have a choice between thread confinement ( unfortunately , the default , which is obsolete ) , and queue confinement . With thread confinement , you can only use a managed object context from the thread where it was created . If you created your managed object context on the main thread ( or queue ) , you can only use it from there - so any Core Data operation you perform on that context will block the main thread , and in turn the UI . Using queue confinement ( almost ) any operation on the managed object context must go through either the performBlock : or performBlockAndWait : methods . The enqueued block is executed on the context 's serial queue . This is far less failure prone than thread confinement and has been the recommended practice for concurrency since iOS 5 . [OUTPUT] Typically this would be done using an NSFetchedResultsController , which observes a managed object context for changes relevant to it 's fetch request . Once the initial fetch populates the controller it will listen for changes to the context that affect the objects specified by the fetch request . When relevant changes occur the controller informs it 's delegate through callbacks .",

Thanks , Brian Yes , your expression fatally confuses the JIT optimizer . The generated machine code looks like this : [CODE] The bug occurs at address 41 , the optimizer has concluded that value will always be null so it directly passes a null to String.Concat() . For comparison , this is the code that 's generated when JIT optimization is turned off : [CODE] The code got moved , but do note that at address 5c it now uses the local variable ( value ) instead of null .

I can able to create Package and it 's working fine . I will process the dwg file using forge api preparing to viewer . I can able to view dwg in browser . My issue is I have viewer click event the event click populate the element id . However , my package I can get only the object id . element id and object id totally different . What is the conman id each object client and server side . Summary : when user click the object in viewer I want to capture id and store my local database . and using package I need to process the user clicked object . Example : when user click the drawing number in viewer . From the next time I want change the drawing number dynamically using call package from C# code . For an RVT file , one easy way to handle this is to extract the Forge externalId from the Forge object properties . That is equal to the Revit element UniqueId property . The RvtMetaProp Revit add-in makes use of this . Oh , now I just found a better , more complete and succinct explanation of Unique IDs for Forge Viewer Elements : The Viewer gives access to three types of IDs when dealing with Revit files : dbId : this is viewer specific and used to manipulate elements within the viewer , such as for the .getProperties() method . Revit ElementID : exposed as part of the Name property in the viewer . When you select something , the Property panel title is in the form of ' Name [ 12345 ] ' . You can parse this name string and extract the element id . Revit UniqueID : exposed as the externalId property in the .getProperty() response .",

    "text": "I 'm trying to send objects retrieved by NHibernate over WCF , but whenever a have a property of ICollection I get an exception . When NHibernate gets the data from the database this property is intitialized with an instance of PersistentGenericSet . Is there a way I can send a PersistentGenericSet over WCF ? -or - Is there some way making NHibernate initialize these properties with another type ? The PersistentGenericSet is part of NHibernate ( used to track changes in collections ) . It is based on the ISet interface and classes from Iesi.Collections , which was used to fill a gap in the .Net framework as there is n't a Set type . I guess that WCF has a problem serializing this type . A quick fix is to change your NHibernate mappings to use a Bag instead of a Set . Then you can use a normal IList <T> instead of Set<T> in your classes w . A better solution is to create a remote facade which sends DTOs to your WCF endpoints . This will allow you to keep the interface of your internal types separate from those exposed as remote services . Jimmy Bogards Automapper is a great tool which will help with the mapping process . Edit After re-reading the problem I had a look around the and came across this article which describes a workaround for sending NHibernate collections over WCF .

    "text": "I have an installer created using Installshield 2012 that depends greatly on the value of a Registry key written by some other application developed in-house . I use RegDBGetKeyValueEx Installscript API to fetch the value . This value is a directory path guaranteed to have a trailing backslash . This value serves as the TARGETDIR for my installer . The issue is that I often see a foreign character ( Chinese , Japanese or Korean ) appended to the backslash.This causes my TARGETDIR to contain the foreign character . This pollutes my installation . I feel this is some bug with Installscript API which wrongly translates the Registry value . Please provide some inputs so that I may find the root-cause of the issue . EDIT 1 : The other application in question is a purely ANSI application with no support for Unicode . There is no [CODE] specified anywhere . I also checked the compiler parameters and found nothing related to Unicode specified . This application reads one Registry key and appends a backslash and updates other keys . Once this operation is done my installer fetches the values written : [CODE] The values updated in the above code are then written to registry . The Installscript code that fetches these values is : [CODE] EDIT 2 : The way the registry value is set seems to be wrong : [CODE] I feel the correct code should have been : [CODE] In some code pages the currency symbol is the same byte value in ASCII as the backslash . If you 're using Unicode functions this should n't be an issue though . See http://www.siao2.com/2005/09/17/469941.aspx for more information . When assigning the Registry data to your m_reqPath variable , you are treating it as null-terminated character data . However , string data read by RegQueryValueEx() is not guaranteed to be null-terminated , if the original writer of the data did not include one . This is clearly stated in the documentation . Chances are that the string data you are reading from the Registry is not null-terminated , so you end up copying random data from the end of your buffer . To account for that possibility , you need to allocate extra space in your buffer and put your own null terminator at the end of whatever data you actually read . If the data is properly null terminated , then your terminator will simply be redundant . You are also leaking the opened Registry key handle if RegOpenKeyEx() succeeds but RegQueryValueEx() fails . Try this instead : [CODE] To avoid this issue altogether , use RegGetValue() instead , which deals with the null terminator for you : [CODE] Or : [CODE]",

But data appears before the progressbar goes invisible and notifyDataSetChange() fired , help me please ! An AsyncTask that returns nothing from doInBackground() ( and does n't communicate with onPostExecute() via private members ) is always suspicious . You have a lot of side effects in your AsyncTask and that kind of stuff is hard to debug . You add to cityList and activeOrders for example , without showing what that actually is . Presumably those are lists attached to some Adapter and adding to those might trigger a View attached to the Adapter to be re-drawn . If that is the case you could try calling setNotifyOnChange(false) on mAdapter ( to delay updates until you manually call notifyDataSetChanged() later ) . http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ArrayAdapter.html#setNotifyOnChange(boolean) In general , if your AsyncTask does n't return anything or otherwise \" communicate \" with onPostExecute() there is little point in having onPostExecute() in the first place . Even better would be not to have any side effect in doInBackground() and instead return the parsed data and only add it to cityList and activeOrders in onPostExecute() . Multi-threading is tricky and AsyncTasks while appearing/attempting to make it easier , have many pitfalls . I have attempted to answer a question on thread safety of AsyncTask here I do n't have the privilege to comment , so I 'll post it here : You do n't happen to have listeners on your ordersDatabase , cityList or activeOrders ?",

    "text": "I have a WPF DataGrid with the following definition . [CODE] This allows me to have the user selected a \" region \" of cells . The DataGrid is bound to an observable collection . The XAML column definitions have some columns hidden , some visible like this : [CODE] I also have a Right Mouse Button context menu defined for the DataGrid : [CODE] I would like to be able to Click , Drag and Drop a copy of the currently selected cells into an external application . I was thinking of using the combination of pressing the \" Alt Key \" and Left Mouse Button click to initiate the DragDrop operation . For example , consider the \" irregular \" selection of cells in the DataGrid : I am unclear on how to proceed and have several questions regarding this : 1) What events do I override so that the /Left Mouse click do not affect the currently selected cells ? 2) How do I determine whether the Left Mouse Button click is occurring within a region of selected cells ? How do I handle the data piece ? 3) Once I 've determined the above , what is the next step ? Do copy data into the clipboard for use on the external drop ? 4) What events ( if any ) do I need to override on the DataGrid in order for this to work ? Thanks the basic events to drag and drop are : events to drag and drop Specially the DragLeave and Drop to do what you want . Then you need to control ( delete/add ) the GridData property from your VM to search and move the values . I strongly recommend 3rd party like Telerik to do it . Here is your complete answer I believe . [CODE] Here you need to have the shift key down to signal the drag . This is needed to disambiguate the click and drag that is used in the DataGrid to select cells . You might use some other mechanism such as context menu item . The clipboard is key to any drag and drop operation . What you are doing is putting data on the clipboard in various formats that the target of the drop will recognize . In this example only plain text is used . But you might want to create rich text or HTML or any number of other formats . The external application you are dropping on must be registered as a drop target . You cannot force the other app to respond to the drop ... it must be listening for it . So this example will work with Word and Excel . It will not work with Notepad . I believe all 4 items are satisfied : Override the preview mouse down event . The original source of the mouse event comes from the data grid cell . If the cell is selected then you are within the block of cells that is selected . For the selected cells , gather the data from the bindings and organize into a grid . As a baseline use plain text but optionally add other formats as well . Use the DragDrop class to actually implement the drag and drop . Override preview mouse down .",

    "text": "I 'm using Java 6 . Do you think there 's a reason why there are conditional expressions [CODE] and not loop expressions [CODE] which adds elements from schedule into weeklyPlan while hasNext() . Or do some languages have this feature or something similar ? These \" loop expressions \" , in a slightly different form , are called closures . In groovy-code : [CODE] That is - you can define what happens with each object of the schedule collection . Java does not yet support closures . There it is implemented with anonymous classes . Of course closures are more than that , and this is only one of their applications . I think it 's because conditional expressions are much easier to implement without having to worry about pesky details . For example , looking at your code , are you saying that weeklyPlan.add will be called multiple times ? In that case , the scope of your [CODE] operator just jumped outside of the parentheses that contain it . C# has features in LINQ that can perform similar actions to what you 're describing . It implements these using closures and extension methods : [CODE] But these are much more tricky language constructs than Java started out with and the .NET runtime has been able to change much more rapidly than the Java platform has , largely for political reasons . Java 7 was supposed to feature closures , but they got pushed back to the \" next version . \"",

However , we can have a number of runnable processes . These are all of these processes who are waiting for the scheduler to schedule their execution . At any given time , do all these runnable processes exist in user address space ? Or has the currently running process in user address space , and it is only once they are scheduled that they are brought back to RAM from disk . In which case , does it mean that the kernel keeps the process task descriptor in its list of all runnable processes even if they are in disk ? I guess you can tell I am confused . If CPU supports virtual memory addressing , each process has a unique view of the memory . Two different processes that tries to read from the same memory address , will map to different location in physical memory , unless the memory maps tells otherwize ( shared memory , like DLL files are mapped read only like this for instance ) If CPU does not support virtual memory , but only memory protection , the memory from the other processes will be protected away , so that the running process can only access its own memory .",

The value of GBP would be determined by my own currency conversion ratio . So I 'm assuming what I 'd first need to do is use a regular expression to get all instances of the prices which would be anything beginning with USD$ and ending after .xx ? Prices will always have cents displayed . Then I 'm stuck what would be the best way to accomplish the next part . Should I wrap these instances in a span tag with a class , then use jquery.each() function to loop through each and replace the contents with a jquery(this).html(\"GBP\u00a3YY.yy\") ? Any help setting me on the right path would be greatly appreciated . Thanks guys . base method for text replacements : [CODE] stuff you need to do : [CODE] you can fire that on ANY site . it will even replace titles etc . so. . to tell you about the benefits of not using jquery for this : jquery will process and wrap every single element in a browser compatible way . using a native javascript solution would speed up this process alot . using native textnodes also is benefitial since it will not break event handlers for child elements . you should also consider using fastdom . it does not matter if you are using jquery or native js . after writing to elements the dom has to do certain tasks before it can be read again . in the end you will loose some time for each edited element . to give you a fastdom example : [CODE] this will basically do the job in an instant . if you want to go even further you could add this to jquery as following : [CODE] and call it like that : [CODE] If all of these values are directly in the span , if not you can give them a unique class and use it to iterate over them , you can use the following You first get the numeric part of the string in a variable convert the currency store it in other variable . replace US$ with GBP replace numeric part of the string with converted value jQuery : [CODE]",

I am trying to store the user information in an one of them and then send it to a file , which should I use ? Thank you . To decide between using an ArrayList/Vector or a HashMap depends on whether you have key-value pairs or simple a list of elements . For key-value pairs a HashMap is the go-to option ( e.g name - person object ) . If you just have objects but no real keys ( a list of trees in a forest ) then a ArrayList or Vector would be better . The difference between Vector and ArrayList is more subtle . If you want more information on the difference between the two you can read this article . But as the article is from 2001 , the information is n't the newest . In most cases , the ArrayList is the better choice and Vector is pretty much considered deprecated nowadays . As the biggest difference between the two is , that Vector is synchronized while ArrayList is n't , which in most cases , makes the Vector slower than the ArrayList as it creates unnecessary overhead . For more information you can look at this question : Why is Java Vector class considered obsolete or deprecated ?",

When I hover the mouse over the variable in debug mode I see 0.100000000000001 What is the cause of this change and how do I stop it please ? Method Definition : [CODE] Method Call with literal value of 0.1 : [CODE] My environment is Windows 64 bit OS using Qt 5.2.1 and compiling using Microsoft 2010 Visual Studio compiler in 32 bit . Many decimal numbers are not exactly representable in IEEE floating point ( i.e . the binary representation used for double ) and 0.1 falls in this camp . When you type 0.1 the C++ compiler is required to convert that into a double to be represented on your hardware . It does so by computing a near approximation of this and so you see a bit of error . If you try something like a power of two : 0.5 , 0.25 these will be exactly represented . See this link for a much more in-depth description of the idea . This is normal behaviour in any computer . It 's caused by the fact that decimal numbers are being stored in fixed-sized binary memory . The extra digits come from the inherent errors caused by converting from binary to decimal . You will not get rid of them . The best you can do is choose a precision ( either float or double ) that is big enough so that the extra error digits will not make any difference to your solution , and then chop them off when you display the number .",

    "text": "When my view controller is first presented , I want it to potentially update a cache that provides the data for that view . However , when the user taps the back button from a deeper view controller to return to this view controller , I do n't want to update the cache again . Which event should I be using ? in init , I do n't have all the parameters I need yet . viewWillAppear will be fired every time the view will appear . viewDidLoad will be fired every time the view has been loaded from the nib , which I believe could happen a second time if there 's a memory warning . ( Or is this wrong ? ) Since this is not a memory resident cache , it seems the wrong place to handle this . having the caller call something extra is inelegant , if there 's a built-in way to handle this . To clarify , this is not a memory resident cache . This is parsing an XML file to binary . The binary is loaded and unloaded in viewDidLoad and viewDidUnload . This is a prerequisite for that step , making sure the binary is up-to-date prior to it being loaded . load the cache in viewDidLoad and release it in viewDidUnload and dealloc . viewDidUnload is called during low-memory conditions . if you want your app to remain responsive , you 'd free up as much memory as you can . well explained here : When should I release objects in -(void)viewDidUnload rather than in -dealloc ? Using init may work , but I would recommend a simple subclass of UINavigationController . Create a new method called [CODE] , or something like it . In the method implementation call this : [CODE] reloadData will call all of your delegate and data source methods , and use them to update the table . If you want a special method call on your table view controller instead , you could change the method declaration to [CODE] ( or whatever your custom table controller is called ) , and replace the reloadData line with one that calls that method . Then , in your app delegate , instead of creating a UINavigationController and adding your custom view controller , create one of these , and call this method to add the first view . However , if you are using a nib to set the rootViewController , you can just override [CODE] , as I imagine that is what the nib will call to set the first view in the stack : [CODE] Hope this helps !",

Since your link is inside of the form like your input , you could do this : [CODE] http://jsfiddle.net/376fLujs/4/ I would say try using this for your event handling : [CODE] The reason it might not be working is because the element might not yet be created when the script loads . This should take care of that issue .",

    "text": "I 'm trying to set up my virtual ( xen ) win xp instances , a dedicated windows server , and a dedicated windows xp desktop pc for web app UI testing , using selenium-rc and the selenium PHP API from pear ( the php script running the tests sits on its app server , on the same local network as the remote-controlled windowses ) . Everything has worked out great so far , except i am unable to get a screenshot from selenium RC - they are all blank ( gray ) after base64_decode() ; ( without that , they dont even open ) . Despite os x preview displays them as gray , i 'm pretty sure they are actually transparent or have some kind of other corruption because Photoshop wont open them at all . ( and they weigh 0.7k ) The unix \" [CODE] \" command however recognizes them correctly as \" PNG image , 1440 x 900 , 8-bit/color RGB , non-interlaced \" - 1440 x 900 is the resolution of my Mac , connected to the windows systems through remote desktop . I 'm running the selenium rc directly ( ie [CODE] ) , not as a service . The symptoms are the same accross all my windows test systems . My Selenium version is 1.0.1 , here 's the snippet that tries to get the screenshot : [CODE] [CODE] I 'm using the latest Testing_Selenium pear package . I realize there is a question here dealing with a similar issue , but i 'm not using a service wrapper nor i can afford to introduce this complexity ( but do let me know if you think that 's a mistake ) thanks & regards , Andras ps : i 'm cross posting this to several forums in a desperate attempt to get some imput - apologies if that upsets you :-) edit : selenium rc console says [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] [OUTPUT] for all screen captures . When there is no physical desktop ( or remote desktop session ) , the Java process that runs Selenium RC will result in a black screenshot . Without knowing more info , this could be your problem . As the creator of Selenium RC , I actually recommend against using the Windows Service entirely . Instead , do what we do at BrowserMob , which provides free monitoring and free load testing services , as well as a recently launch instant test tool that takes screenshots of your site from multiple locations . What we do is launch everything from under the context of a VNC session . On Windows , configure VNC to launch a session upon startup . Then make sure the user auto-logs in . Then place a .bat file in Program Files->Startup that launches Selenium RC . It 's kind of a pain , but it 's the most reliable way I 've found for ensuring that Selenium RC starts in an environment that supports screenshots , launching IE , interacting with native events , etc . Good luck ! Have you seen a similar question ? Maybe that could help you . I had similar adventures .",

The problem is you expect that Javascript contained within an ajax response is executed . This is n't the case , the browser does n't execute any Javascript contained within ajax responses . It might be possible to try to parse out the Javascript and execute it in some way , such as eval() but that would be nasty and not a good idea . Using eval() you also have to consider that it will only accept valid Javascript , so you could n't just pass your response to it because that includes some HTML . A possible solution could be to have the popup() function already defined in the page or an external Javascript file , and to assign the click handler after you add the HTML to the DOM .

    "text": "I am a beginner . I am finding it very difficult to understand one concept here . [OUTPUT] Please help me understand the concept . Solution : [CODE] MyApp.Web references MyApp.Logic , and MyApp.Logic references MyApp.Data . On my application , what I am trying to do is simply bind a gridview by the tablename , which is chosen from a dropdownlist . However , there are hundreds and more tables . The purpose here is just to display data to the user ( with paging ) . So a class \" Get_Data \" on project MyApp.Data has a function : [CODE] From MyApp.Logic , I am just passing the datatable from the MyApp.Data tier to MyApp.Web . And then the gridview is bound and everything is working here . So what I am doing wrong here ? Is it really bad to have datatable in UI level ? Why is it a bad design ? The notion that it is bad practice for your UI to create/load/consume a datatable comes from the idea that it is preferable to split your application into layers that specialize , the most common split is to have 3 layers : Layer 1 is a data layer responsible for communicating with the database and populating domain objects , the domain objects are typically defined in layer 2 which also holds the business logic for your application . by domain objects i mean classes that represent real things like customer , bank account , hotel room etc . and by business logic i mean the rules that apply to domain objects during events i.e . when a hotel room is booked a confirmation is sent to the customer . the third layer is the UI layer , to simplyfy coding this should only deal with whats in layer 2 , this is where the recommendation to not use datatables in your UI comes from . the motivation to split your application really start to make sense when your application is big , or you have multiple developers working on it , or your using unit testing . If you 're in that situation then i 'd try and find a friendly member of your team to explain this better , but if this is just you writing an application on your own then i would n't worry too much about it , write lots of code , read lots of books and this stuff will make more sense , i would recommend the craig larman book on uml and patterns . hope this helps",

    "text": "I 'm writing some software that talks to external hardware via a dll ( moving some motors and reading some values back ) . The calls to the dll are blocking and may not return for in the order of 10 seconds . The software performs a scan by moving the hardware , taking a reading and repeating for a number of points . One scan can take in the order of 30 minutes to complete . While the scan is running I would obviously like the GUI to be responsive and a live graph ( in an MDI Child ) of the incoming data to be updated at each point . Multithreading seems the obvious choice for this problem . My question is , what is the best way to thread this and talk back to the main VCL thread to update the graph during a scan ? I currently have a single TThread descendant that performs the ' scan logic ' and an array of doubles in the public var section of the ChildForm . I need to fill out this array from the thread but I do n't know whether to use Synchronize or CriticalSection or PostMessage or some other method . Each time a new value is added , the main VCL thread needs to update the graph . Should I really have an intermediary object for the data that is a global var and access this from the Thread and the ChildForm separately somehow ? I find that populating a TThreadList from the background thread , then posting a message to the main thread that there is a new item in the list , then processing the list in the main thread is simple and easily maintainable . With this method , you could store as many readings as you wanted in the list , and every time the main thread received a message , it would simply process all the items in the list at once . Define a class for the readings , instantiate them , and add them to the list in the background thread . Do n't forget to free them in the main thread when you pop them off the list . If you want to invest a little more then a simple Synchronize call which by the way blocks the main thread , you can add a simple FIFO queue with messaging on top of it . The flow of data would be like this : The thread puts the data into the queue . The thread post a message to the main thread window . Which one I do n't care :) You handle the message that data is available and process any messages in the queue as you see fit . The code would look something like this : the queue .. . [CODE] the data is put into the queue .. . [CODE] and processing .. . [CODE] The code is written without Delphi and checks so it can contain errors . I showed the example using my freely available thread safe queue and TAnyValue . You can find both here : http://www.cromis.net/blog/downloads/ Also please note then I did not do any check if PostMessage was actually sent . You should check that in production code .",

    "text": "SOLUTION Well , that 's what I get when I use a bit oldish Symfony2 release ( 2.0-RC6 ) . It seems that there was a bug in __construct of RoleSecurityIdentity ( reported back in December ' 10 ) . Instead of instance of Role it should be instance of RoleInstance . I should probably close this question .. . I 'm pretty new to whole ACL concept in Symfony2 but I understand basics behind it . Last night I was trying to make next scenario work : I have 2 user roles ( ROLE_GROUP1 , ROLE_GROUP 2) and I want to setup object-level ACL for the one of these groups . If user with ROLE_GROUP1 is logged in it should put this role into ACE , otherwise it should put ROLE_GROUP2 . So far I wrote this code ( really almost identical to official docs ) : [CODE] The way I understand it , this should grant all permissions to users with ROLE_GROUP1 role . Am I wrong ? To check for permissions I used this code ( again , from official docs ) : [CODE] .. . but it always fails ( that is throws an exception ) . I looked into the ACL tables and everything seemed normal , as far as I could see . Am I doing something wrong with RoleSecurityIdentity ? Is there any way to achieve this scenario ? Any help would be much appreciated ! EDIT I just drilled down through the Symfony 's code and found out that permission grant fails in equals method of RoleSecurityIdentity . [CODE] It turns out that [CODE] is string \" ROLE_GROUP1 \" while [CODE] is Role object of ROLE_GROUP1 role . Just to mark this question as resolved .

    "text": "So confusingly @IfProfileValue has nothing to do with @Profile or @ActiveProfiles . @Profile tests to see if a profile is active , @ActiveProfiles sets them as active , and @IfProfileValue allows you to check things in Spring Environment . Wut ? I 'd deprecate all of them and add new ones @IfEnvironment , @IfProfile , and @ActivateProfiles . Commentary aside , how can I use @IfProfileValue to detect whether i have a profile active ? I am not using Spring Boot on this project , at this time . Answers should show code , and we will assume that I want the test to run if the profile is activated as @ActiveProfiles ( \" test \" ) . I tried [CODE] [CODE] but that seems to have the test skipped , which means it 's not matching . I 'm going to speculate the problem may have to do with the fact that ActiveProfiles is a Collection . [OUTPUT] That 's correct , and I explained this in detail here : https://stackoverflow.com/a/23627479/388980 .. . which I 'm assuming you have already seen , since you commented on my answer yesterday . The reason that @IfProfileValue has nothing to do with @Profile or @ActiveProfiles is due to the evolution of the framework . See below for further details . [OUTPUT] These statements are not entirely correct , especially the last part . @Profile is used to selectively enable a component ( e.g . , @Service , etc . ) , @Configuration class , or @Bean method if one of the named bean definition profiles is active in the Spring Environment for the ApplicationContext . This annotation is not directly related to testing : @Profile should not be used on a test class . @ActiveProfiles is used to designate which bean definition profiles ( e.g . , those declared via @Profile ) should be active when loading an ApplicationContext for an integration test . @IfProfileValue does not allow you to check things in the Spring Environment . I 'm not sure why you are assuming this , since none of the documentation in the Spring Framework states that . As I stated in the aforementioned thread : Please note that @IfProfileValue was introduced in Spring Framework 2.0 , long before the notion of bean definition profiles , and @ActiveProfiles was first introduced in Spring Framework 3.1 . In the aforementioned thread , I also pointed out the following : The term ' profile ' is perhaps misleading when considering the semantics for @IfProfileValue . The key is to think about ' test groups ' ( like those in TestNG ) instead of ' profiles ' . See the examples in the JavaDoc for @IfProfileValue . [OUTPUT] That depends , and .. . I 'm assuming you mean bean definition profile when you say \" profile \" . If you 're using @ActiveProfiles to set the bean definition profiles for your tests , you cannot currently use @IfProfileValue to determine if a bean definition profile is active , since the bean definition profiles configured via @ActiveProfiles are set directly in the test 's ApplicationContext and not as a Java system property . However , if you are setting the bean definition profiles only via the spring.profiles.active system property , then it would be possible to use @IfProfileValue to determine if a bean definition profile is active , since @IfProfileValue in fact works with system properties . For example , you could then use the following : [CODE] [OUTPUT] That wo n't work since activeProfiles is the incorrect property name . The correct system property name is spring.profiles.active . See AbstractEnvironment.ACTIVE_PROFILES_PROPERTY_NAME for details . The fact that @IfProfileValue does not work in harmony with @ActiveProfiles is a known issue to the Spring team . Please consult the following JIRA issues for further details and to join in on the discussions if you 'd like . https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-7754 https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8982 https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-11677 Hope this clarifies the situation for you ! Sam ( author of the Spring TestContext Framework ) Sam nailed it . ( As well as the fact this was accepted and answered years back ) One thing to add is that if you 'd like to pass System Properties through to your test , having them propagate through to the JVM if you are using a build tool like gradle may require an additional step . [CODE] And then business as usual in your integration test [CODE] Finally you can execute your tests from the terminal with the property you specified . [CODE] The thing I like most about @IfProfileValue over grabbing the System.property and checking assumeTrue/False manually is that no Spring Context is loaded ( or flyway/other migrations you may have ) keeping unit tests fast .",

    "text": "Firstly , I know LocationManager does n't have to be called in an AsyncTask as it 's already non UI blocking :) I have an activity which 1 . Gets the users current location 2 . Calls a webservice to retrieve a list of specific POIs around that location . The user can choose to view the results as map or list using a TabActivity . Bearing this in mind the AsyncTask to get users location and call to webservice is managed by the TabActivity view rather than either of the docked views . So I want the TabActivity to start an AsyncTask which first gets the users location , then calls the webservice . A progress dialog prevents switching views using the tabs during this process . It 's pretty much all working apart from getting the users location from the AsyncTask . The webservice code is written , the mapping and overlay code is written , the task progress dialog copes with orientation changes . The focus on location is speed rather than accuracy . If the user chooses to view results on the mapview then I will provide a ' My location ' button which will enable a more accurate location to be obtained . I just want to initially get a rough location and return the search results quickly . Maybe I 'm going about this the wrong way . Maybe I should display the map view , let the map activity find the current location , then call just the webservice in the async - but then what if the user taps the list view tab during the location phase ? I was also going to allow the user to specify their default view - some people may prefer a list to a map . In this case I would have a listview which had to retrieve the location . Thanks for any advice Martin . I sussed it . The problem I was having was that the LocationListener was not being called in the AsyncTask . The reason for this was that although I 'd created and prepared a lopper in the thread I had n't called Looper.Loop() I start the requestLocationUpdates , kick off a timer . Either the locationmanager responds with a location , or the timer expires . At this point I call looper.quit() to ensure things return to normal . Seems to be working . You also have to remember to respond to the back button etc , cancelling the timer and looper if the AsyncTask is cancelled .",

Code : [CODE] When I tried to print things out , they appeared like this : Fit between Elizabeth Bennett and Elizabeth Bennett : 90.0 Fit between Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy : 90.55 Fit between Elizabeth Bennett and Romeo Montague : 90.3 Fit between Elizabeth Bennett and Juliet Capulet : 90.0 so ....................................................... on so forth . There was a \" 9 \" appearing in front of my numbers . I found the problem later : I had two concatenating operators [CODE] after my \" \\n \" . So I changed my code , deleting the extraneous [CODE] . New code : [CODE] New correct run : Fit between Elizabeth Bennett and Elizabeth Bennett : 0.0 Fit between Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy : 0.55 Fit between Elizabeth Bennett and Romeo Montague : 0.3 Fit between Elizabeth Bennett and Juliet Capulet : 0.0 so .............................................. on so forth . Though I 've thankfully found my problem , I want to know what exactly is causing this to happen . Is there some sort of eclipse shorthand that leads to the \" 9 \" ' s appearance ? Or is this due to some eclipse bug ? I 'm still a beginner at java , so I ca n't make a solid conclusion . I tried modifying my code slightly to see how Eclipse would react ( I deleted the space between my original [CODE] ) : [CODE] Eclipse gave me this warning : Multiple markers at this line Syntax error on token \" [CODE] \" , [CODE] expected Invalid argument to operation [CODE] / [CODE] This makes sense , because [CODE] on its own is an operator of sorts . Interestingly , however , if I put a space between the \" [CODE] \" , then the warning disappears . I did n't paste my entire code for the sake of readability , but if necessary , I can edit and add it in . Some clarification regarding this would be helpful . Thank you . No , it 's not a bug . It 's unusual , but it 's not a bug . The first thing to do is simplify the example massively : [CODE] Result : [CODE] Now admittedly I 'm using strings for both start and end , but due to [CODE] being left-associative , that does n't make any difference here . ( If start were an integer , the first binary [CODE] operator would be integer addition in both cases . ) Basically , the extra [CODE] ends up being a unary [CODE] operator with ' \\t ' as the operand . Unary numeric promotion is applied to the char , giving int as a result . So the code becomes effectively : [CODE] which is effectively : [CODE] which is effectively [CODE] .. . at which point it 's hopefully clear why you 're getting the output you are . To avoid accidentally ending up treating a character as an integer , it 's probably best to just use strings instead - at which point the code wo n't compile because there 's no unary [CODE] operator for String : [CODE] . . gives : [CODE] The problem is not just with the [CODE] in your code . But it 's also with the fact that you are using char ' \\t ' and not String \" \\t \" . So when you use [CODE] [CODE] , the \\t is taken as a character literal and appended to the string as \\t . But when you use [CODE] [CODE] , it becomes effectively [CODE] [CODE] [CODE] [CODE] . So it is treated as an int by java . You only assign [CODE] and [CODE] signs to ints , not chars . Remember you can do [CODE] or [CODE] or [CODE] . And the ASCII value of \\t is 9 . Hence it gets appended to the string and get 's printed as Hello9 .",

    "text": "I 'm trying to write some generic code for handling drops in WPF drop targets . AllowDrop is set to true , and I 've hooked onto DragEnter , DragOver , DragLeave , & Drop on the drop target UIElement . Using the bubbling events enables nesting of drop targets . Note I have no access to the drag source - this is inter-application drag & drop . If I have some UI cleanup to perform at the end of a potential drop , and the user presses Esc to cancel the drop , the drop target never seems to gets a specific event that I can differentiate from all the others . Drop is easy - but what indicates a cancel ? The problem I have is this : DragLeave is a bubbling routed event . e.OriginalSource is always set for this event ( and the corresponding Preview ) via hittesting . The target is an ItemsControl ( Listbox is what I 've currently been testing with ) . As I drag over my intended drop target , I get loads of DragLeave events from the child visuals within the target . I never get any from the target itself . Grids , rectangles , borders , textblocks , they all happily send me DragLeave , but none from the actual ItemsControl I 'm connected up to . I thought it might be a hittesting problem , but I 've set the Background of the ItemsControl to a colour , and it makes no difference . What am I missing ? How am I supposed to determine that a drop operation has definitely finished ? ( The actual problem I 'm trying to solve is that I 'm implementing some custom dragging behaviour in a TreeView that expands folders when you hover over them , and cancels timers & undoes the expansion when the drop is finished , and more to come , but I ca n't even get the events to fire sensibly for a ListBox ) . You do have a complex scenario here so this will start basic in hopes of giving you a direction and hopefully a solution . The framework will only inform of a DragEnter event if the control is marked with [CODE] . So make sure you 've done that . It sounds like you have but I just want to be sure . I 'm not sure why you need the DragLeave event but if it 's to grab the selected data the easiest way to get the data is not to hook into DragLeave but to hook into PreviewMouseMove . You can then determine if the mouse is pressed and how far of a distance to move before enacting a DoDragDrop . In this event , you also have the ability to add and analyze Drag Data . When the drag starts you can create a new DataObject and send it with the DoDragDrop call : [CODE] This drag data is now accessible through the DragEventArgs object by using ( if you do n't rename the event parameter , it 's e ) : [CODE] My suggestion is to add some unique information to the drag event data to differentiate the event based on the data . Either your data item from the listbox selection , or a new class holding your data item and another indicator if needed . check for e.Source and not e.OriginalSource , if you have set [CODE] on the ItemsControl & you have DropOver event attached to the ItemsControl , the event argument e.Source should be ItemsControl .",

What 's the preferred method(s) of automating the entire process as a series of sequential scripts ? EDIT : All of this is run on MySQL dbs . Similar to MAW 's answer , except I would use a Windows Service instead of a command line app ( no GUI ) , and split out the individual DB scripts into separate tasks within the Service so that they can if necessary be called at different time intervals , log their results separately , and be independently configured . This depends greatly on your DBMS . In SQL Server there are scheduled jobs which can run any combination of stored procedures/commands on a schedule , similar to Windows scheduled tasks . Since you 've tagged this question with mysql , I 'll assume thats what your running . One way to do this on mysql is : http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/event-feature.html If all else fails , you can reference all of these scripts in a stored procedure , than create a simple command line program which would connect to that db and call that procedure . Then schedule that program with Windows Task scheduler or similar .",

    "text": "Given three major competing applications each implementing a slightly different data schema for the same problem domain , I am faced with the task of implementing : a \" canonical \" data schema expressive enough to represent something like the intersection set of features of all 3 applications as well as additional details ( meta data ) converters for doing ( bidirectional ) data exchange between those 3 applications and the canonical schema How I currently approach the task The canonical schema is defined using XSD and closely resembles the data schema of one of the 3 applications , let 's call it A . This renders data exchange with A trivial . In order to allow for a bidirectional data exchange with applications B and C ( create some state in A , load it into B , alter it in B , load the altered state into A ) , I try to map simples states in A onto more complex states in B/C which can be identified and deconstructed in the reverse mapping . [OUTPUT] Why I want to change my approach Most of the schema mappings are pretty trivial ( the name of an object in A simply maps to the name of the object in B ) , so I would like to avoid writing a lot of trivial code by hand . I imagine that this trivial code could be generated given a formalized mapping between the data schemes . For the nontrivial parts of the mapping ( like the one desribed above ) , I expect lots of changes in the future simply because it seems so arbitrary . In many cases a specific convention for mapping states in A onto more complex states in B/C might run into a dead end at some point . For example it might become necessary for users to change the \" mirrored subspace \" label and therefore another approach for identifying conversion artifacts might be necessary . I imagine that a formalized mapping could be a tool to transparently manage those conventions . Maybe a reasoner could even automatically spot incoherent , inconsistent mappings . It might also allow me to more easily discuss the mapping with domain experts and users . Questions From what I read about ontologies I have the impression that what I want is an ontology . Is this correct ? As I understand it , using an ontology to describe the mapping would also require me to express the data schemes themselves in the ontology ( so a relation \" maps to \" can reference a type from A and a type from B ) . Since those schemes are taken from long-lived applications , they are not always coherent . For example , a \" feature \" in the application might cause some state to have a different semantic that you would expect from the semantics of its constituents . Can existing tools help me with managing those complexities ? I expect that I would require some additional machinery inside the ontology to describe something like -taken from the example above - the difference between a \" permanent mirrored subspace \" and a \" dissipating mirrored subspace \" ( two types + a special relation reconnecting them ? ) . Would this be much effort to do ? Do available ontology languages provide something out-of-the-box to express this ? Is this application of ontologies a common application for ontologies or is it a corner case ? Do you know of companies who provide services for this application ? Which tools would you suggest for creating the ontology ? I assume there are no off-the-shelf tools available for the code generation mentioned . So how would you approach the code generation task ? Abstracting a type system , a set of interfaces , and rules for transformation is defined as subset of ontology creation known as a meta-model .

    "text": "This is my first time on stackexchange , facing a problem I have n't been able to find a solution to with numerous hours spent on Google . Apologies in advance for the lack of more images , stackexchange will not allow me to more photos until my reputation is higher . I need to get results from a .do page : http://webapps2.rrc.state.tx.us/EWA/productionQueryAction.do The url remains static when a large query e.g is submitted - I cannot alter my query by changing the url . Once submitted , it takes a long time to load , and after loading , a table of results is presented . I then require all the data to be on one page so I select ' View All ' as the page size from the drop down menu on the top left of the table to obtain the following page ( which has many more rows than displayed here ) Finally , to then import this data , I open a spreadsheet and copy-paste it all in . Even for one county/query/submission , this process is extremely tedious , and I have to do this monthly for about 20 counties , then a further 10 districts . Due to the long load time associated with the return of each query , this is a task that easily takes 2-3 hours to complete . As such , I am hoping someone here has some kind of solution to automate/ease the process , or even simply advice as to where I can find information to create a solution myself . If I could directly query the database import the data into a spreadsheet , my problem would be solved . The load times are irrelevant if the entire process of querying the server can be automated as it could just run in the background without user input . I apologise for the long and non-specific question , and any response will be greatly appreciated . Thank you very much . Well , you can actually check the network calls that are executed in order to get the CSV file . I just did that for you , but it contains a lot of parameters which you need to send in . Below are the actual parameters you need to send in : [CODE] I hope for you that only the parameters prefixed with searchArgs are important ( they contain the information of the form , like the month/year/. . The actionManager prefixed parameters contain some complicated data , you need to define them ( else you get an error ) , but I do n't know if they 're actually used , so you might just leave them empty . When executing this call , you will imediately receive the CSV file which you can probably parse using any language ( look for a CSV parsing library ) and insert it into a database or something else . However , the best possibility is to look for an alternative to this source ( or a public API you can access ) , because this is really crazy to work with , and it might change . Example using PHP The following code is an example in PHP retrieving the CSV ( using cURL ) and parsing it into an array . [CODE] From what you are describing , this sounds like an issue with the Database taking the time to generate the results . If this is the case , do you know if there are any indexes on the database being queried ? If you are querying data across multiple linked tables ( which it looks & sounds like you are ) , without any indexes , then the queries will run like a dog . This website offers a good introduction to indexes that may be worth taking a look at . Other than this , it may be prevalent to setup a cron to automate the process for you like Anusha has described in the comments . I would recommend looking into indexes as well as setting up the cron jobs , as rather than just cut down the amount of time it takes for you to generate the data each month , you could fully automate it , and have it running in a few minutes , rather than hours each month .",

    "text": "I have an EF model where I logically have a \" template \" type and an \" instance of the template type \" Basically my templates are like a work flow and the instances are those templates applied to an object . The association is that a template has zero to many instances , an instance is always based on a template . For example the template may be \" send letter \" which gets applied to a customer to create an instance of the letter sent , which includes the date sent , the pdf of the letter etc . The templates have a few subclasses/types which will always match an instance which also has a corresponding subclass . The issue is how can I ensure that when I create an instance ( which will have a reference to the template ) that the instance is of the correct inherited type . For example if the template is of type TemplateType2 ( inherits from template ) and I add an instance to loan1 . . loan1.TemplateInstances.add(foo) \u2026 I want to ensure that foo is of type InstanceType2 . The way I am doing it now seems like such a hack . I am storing the instance entity name as a scalar value in the template entity , and using reflection to create the correct type of the instance . It works , but it is basically using the value of a property to do mapping , exposing the possibility of all sorts of errors if they do not match the name of the instance name , or worse if they enter the wrong entity name .

    "text": "I 'm trying to parse a string with parentheses of the form [CODE] . The question for example will be of the form \" if segment size < 1.5 , then choose left node , else right \" . The question can be a dictionary with a key and a value . The left and right node represent a complete left or right half tree , which will be traversed recursively until the leaf node is reached . In this manner we will build a binary decision tree . If you can decide on the details of the input format , then use raw python source code . For example you can store your tree in a python dictionary of nodes : [CODE] Now you can parse this tree simply with the python parser . [CODE] Well , if the input format is already specified , then we cannot help you if you do n't share the details of that format . This kind of syntax is really the target for pyparsing . The basic format is simple enough , and in pyparsing , it looks like : [CODE] But once you start to add arithmetic expressions , and boolean operations and support for ' [CODE] ' and ' [CODE] ' operators , things get complicated . Also , this is a recursive grammar , since an action can itself be a nested decision . Pyparsing has built-in support that simplifies definition of arithmetic and boolean expressions , including precedence of operations and gruping in parentheses , plus recursive expressions . Here is the pyparsing grammar in various pieces . First here are some of the basic parsing elements : [CODE] The parse action attached to the number expression will automatically convert the parsed number to a float value at parse time . The Word class takes two strings : a string containing all valid leading characters , and a string of all valid body characters . This varname definition supports variable names similar to Python identifiers . Pyparsing has the operatorPrecedence method that takes an expression for the basic operand definition , and a list of tuples to define each level of operators : an expression for the operators , an integer whether the operator is unary , binary , or ternary , and whether left - or right-associative . operatorPrecedence takes care of the recursive definition of arithmetic expressions nested in parentheses . This expression defines basic 4-function math : [CODE] Now here is the definition of a boolean condition ( which we 'll eventually use to define the decision question ) : [CODE] Your definition of actions was a little sketchy , so I made up some possible statements : an assignment statement , a print statement , and since this is a speech application , a say statement which is very simliar to print . [CODE] In addition to the expression definitions , you 'll notice that some expressions are followed by a quoted string , as if the expression is a function being called with that string . In fact , this \" call \" actually returns a copy of the expression , and the matched tokens are tagged with that name . These results names are very helpful at post-parsing time at picking out the individual matching elements ( similar to named groups in regular expressions ) . Finally , to put these pieces together into your decision expression , here are the question and action expressions : [CODE] Note that the action definition can include a decision , but action is used to define decision . To break this chicken-and-egg dependency , we preface this section with defining decision , but with a placeholder expression using the pyparsing Forward class : [CODE] Then after question and action are defined , we use the ' [CODE] ' operator to \" insert \" the actual expression definition in the existing decision variable : [CODE] Again , I took liberties with your defined format , thinking that an [CODE] might be useful . If you do n't want this to be optional , just remove the [CODE] wrapper around the [CODE] . That defines the grammar , now here are some test cases . Using dump() on the results returned by parseString is a nice way to print out the tokens , and any names attached to them . [CODE] Here 's the output : [CODE] Here is a link to the full parsing program - http://pastebin.com/DnaNrx7j . This is just the first stage , parsing the input . The next step is actually evaluating the expression by processing the returned tokens . The pyparsing wiki example SimpleBool.py ( http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/file/view/simpleBool.py ) includes an example of attaching parse actions to convert parsed tokens into callable class instances that simplify evaluating the results . Hope this helps .",

Why do we need to assign same value to both What will happen if I assign the value CultureInfo(\"fr-FR\") ; to only CurrentUICulture or CurrentCulture ? I would really like to know in detail what CurrentUICulture and CurrentCulture does ? Suppose client pc language setting could be German or French etc . , but I want to develop my application in such a way that whatever language setting is there , my apps will work in that pc with their language setting . I mean that all the controls will show the text in German or French . I do not want to hard code the culture this way CultureInfo(\"fr-FR\") I would rather the user 's language setting dictate the language of my controls . How would I go about doing this ? It 's pretty simple . CurrentCulture is the culture assigned for thread to be used in various culture-specific methods . To example , ToString() one . CurrentUICulture is [OUTPUT] By setting both you ensure what all ToString() works correctly and your form resources are loaded from appropriate satellite . Regarding usage , you may think to provide user with option to change language . To example , I have native German windows , but I set English culture in it ( date format and default culture for console applications ) , while I speak Russian . Which language do you think I will chose when using your software ? =P By default , either take language chosen in installer ( if you have installer in multiple languages and options to change it there ) or current Windows user language preferences . One possible scenario : Preconditions : application is already localized , satellites are there ( if not , read this ) . I do n't like satellites myself , but they are easy to start with . When application starts , you create a list of available languages ( either statically or by enumerating satellites ) . [CODE] Then , if application start for the first time ( to example , you have string language setting and it 's by default null or \"\" , this would be a flag what no language is selected yet ) , you detect default os language [CODE] and if it 's in your list , then you set [CODE] Otherwise , if you do n't have this language , then use \" default \" language ( to example , \" en \" ) . If its done at at the start of your application , then any further constructed and used window will use proper resources . User should be able to change language . Give him possibility to chose one of available Languages . In winforms you will have to reload forms after change culture .

I understand that strlen() returns a size_t type , and by definition this should n't change , but .. . Why would strlen need to return a 64-bit integer ? The function is designed to be used with strings . With that said : Do programmers commonly create multi-gigabyte or multi-terabyte strings ? If they did , would n't they need a better way to determine the string length than searching for a NULL character ? I think this is ridiculous , in fact , maybe we need a StrLenAsync() function with a callback just to handle the ultra long process for searching for the NULL in the 40TB string . Sound stupid ? Yea , well strlen() returns a 64-bit integer ! Of course , the proposed StrLenAsync() function is a joke . Well , 1) size_t is a typedef and varies with architectures and 2) Would n't it make sense to have the largest integer as a return value ? Why 32 bits ? Why not 16 ? It 's 64 on your machine because that 's the max string length possible . It looks like , when compiling for a 64-bit target , size_t is defined as 64-bit . This makes sense , since size_t is used for sizes of all kinds of objects , not just strings .",

    "text": "I 'm attempting to use a MOBILE first approach to responsive design . In doing so , I wish to convert my MAX media queries to MIN media queries . Therefore , instead of using graceful degradation , I aim to implement progressive enhancement Can anyone explain the best way to re-engineer my CSS to use MIN-width media queries as opposed to MAX-width ? In the example below I have trimmed out 95% of the css and have left the breakpoints // ------------------------------MAIN CSS [CODE] // --------------------------------MEDIA [CODE] // --------------------------------MEDIA [CODE] [CODE] Min-width media queries are very easy , to use , and are not too different from using MAX media queries . Here is an example using your code : [CODE] It is important to still use max-width to create limits for the style of objects on certain screens . Using min-width can be especially useful if you want certain styles to apply to a smaller object and then have that same style apply to a larger object . This way you can keep the styles for that minimum size but also add on extra styles to the larger object with out effecting the smaller one . For example : [CODE] In the above example , the styles from screens with a size of over 740px will already be applied to any screens with a size of over 900px . From there you can adjust your styles as you like , reducing the amount of code needed to produce the page . Other Things : -When it comes to actual elements on the screen ( excluding min/max -sizes with [CODE] ) it can always be helpful to use percentages , because that way items can be auto re-sized according to the screen size . -Here is a great website that will help you on your endeavours with media queries : http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/ It totally depends on the rest of your site . Some sites can be displayed well at the width of 400px while some others need to set a minumum because it 's too small to render the document objects in a clean manner . Very often you will not even need to use min-width or max-width when optimizing for mobile , there are far more better practices . Here are some of them : Use Em over Px - It is always better to set font-size and other sizes in units of \" em \" rather than in \" px \" . This is because a pixel is extremely small on a cell phone , whereas em units proportionally adjusts the object to a size that fits the screen . Use Percentages - You 'll find that using percentages are far more friendly than , for instance , specifying the width or height of an element in pixels or em . If you use percentages , your content will always adjust well in for skinny displays . Avoid Absolutely Positioned Elements - Having elements positioned absolutely can be more difficuly to handle on small displays . It simply can , as the absolute elements may get too near to the relatively positioned elements . Use relative positioning as much as possible for a clean site .",

Question is - can I do a insert into table2 select from table1 and in the process cleanse the data from table1 before it goes in ? You can usually create a new , sanitised , table , depending on the actual DB server you are using . The hard thing is that if there are other tables in the database , you may have issues with foreign keys , indexes , etc which will refer to the original table . Whether making a new sanitised table will be quicker than updating your existing table is something you can only tell by trying it . Dump the pk/clustered key of all the records you want to update into a temp table . Then perform the update joining to the temp table . That will ensure the lowest locking level and quickest access . You can also add an identity column to the temp table , than you can loop through and do the updates in batches .",

    "text": "Using CakePHP I have a page where I have multiple forms . Each form updates a single field on a record . I 'm trying to implement a way to submit all the forms through a single \" Submit All \" button . However , all my solutions so far have been lest than successful . My first attempt was to create a separate action called editAll in the controller that took an array , but I cannot figure out how to send the data from all the forms to that action without having a hidden form that saves all that data . The second idea was to create some kind of Javascript function that iterated over all the forms to create an array to be sent to the controller 's editAll action . The first implementation did not work , and I could n't find a reasonable way to implement the second idea . Basically , I was hoping someone could point me in the direction to submitting multiple forms ( or at least the data from multiple forms ) at once from a single page . I assume you do n't ALWAYS want to submit them all - if you do , then just make one form . If you 're hoping to be able to submit some of them individually , but also be able to submit them all , then you could do something along the lines of this : Keep all the fields in one form . For each field have a ' submitted ' value ( 1 or 0 ) . If they click the Submit next to an individual field , turn all of the submitted values to 0 except that one , then submit the form . If they click Submit All , then turn them all to ' 1 ' and submit the form . Then , when you process the data , just strip anything that does n't have ' submitted ' value of 1 . It would still take some work , and you 're submitting more data than is necessary , but ... . it 's an idea .",

    "text": "I am constantly finding myself building programs where there are multiple screens . For example , consider a program where the initial layout offers two buttons : create file or edit file . Upon clicking one , it takes the user to a new screen supporting whatever button they press . Then they click a back button and it takes them back to the main screen of the program . I am wondering how to best do separate menus like this . Would it be best just to create separate methods setting up each screen , then call the appropriate one when a button ( like \" back \" button ) is clicked ? This is what I was thinking of doing , but seeing as there are many ways to do this , I want to get opinions on a possibly better way of changing the screen displayed . Thanks , AJ Based on your 2nd comment to the original question , I think it is best to look at using Panels . Look at using multiple panels for each of the activities you want : [CODE] Ensure all panels are hidden when initialised , and then simply swap a panel for another one upon a button click event using : [CODE] Depending on the layout you use , there are also other techniques . For example , rather than removing and adding ( or showing and hiding multiple panels ) , if you use BorderLayout you can simple \" replace \" a BorderLayout area with another panel and then revalidate : [CODE] Note also that different Operating Systems ( Windows , Mac etc ) will have different styles they like to adhere to . For example you mentioned a typical Windows installer ; people have come to expect an installer to look and work in a certain way , but on a different OS there are a completely different set of expectations and looks . Further reading : Tutorial on using panels Java SE 7 ( JPanel API ) Edit : [OUTPUT] This comes down to personal preference . Do you want to initalise everything on startup and have quicker swaps between panels ( or as you called them : \" screens \" ) , OR do you want a quicker inital startup and essentially have \" lazy loading \" of each component as and when you need it . Personally I opt for everything during initalisation ( unless there is a lot of things to do or load during your applications startup ) . This really comes down to personal preference . Another edit : Speaking about layouts , perhaps a different layout style would also help you out , something like this : CardLayout tutorial Hope this helps out somewhat . If the state of the screen depends on the state of the previous screen ( e.g . like in a wizard ) you can follow the steps described in this article",

If you do n't have a file input library that abstracts this ( and if you absolutely have to support the old Mac format ( as the new MacOS , because the kernel is Unix-based , also uses LF ) ) , treat both LF and CR as a line separator , and do n't count the CR-LF used by Windows twice . Vim What Vim detects is determined by the ' fileformats ' option . You can make it detect Mac as well via [CODE] The first problem even before you get to line breaks is that you 're reading bytes and then treating those as characters . You 're effectively assuming an encoding of ISO-8859-1 which may well not be correct . You should be using an InputStreamReader instead . Then there 's the issue of operating systems having different line breaks. . use BufferedReader.readLine() to read a line in a way that handles line breaks of \\n , \\r or \\r\\n .

    "text": "i seen some tools on github and now vector drawables in Lolipop allow you use svg files . One major advantage i find is that svg files should stretch and keep proper scaling thus looking sharp after stretching . Now with svg files i can keep all my images in the drawable folder instead of filtering them out by density . This makes the apk file smaller which is desirable . Question : Would there be any reason i would not want to take my current PNG images in native android project and convert them to svg files with for example an online converter tool like vector magic ? There are several reasons that you would not want to do this . First , vector drawables are only supported on Android 5.0 + . If you are only targeting Lollipop and above , this wo n't be an issue , but you will still need PNGs for older versions of Android . Second , converting raster to vector will in most cases yield poor results . Instead , you should start by creating the original assets as vector images in a program like Illustrator . Then export to SVG for conversion to VectorDrawable format and export to PNG for the DPI buckets you 'd like to support on pre-5.0 devices .",

I am using that voltage to control the motor and currently I am using the function : [CODE] I am using 255 pwm for 5V and 127 for 2.5V . The problem is that PWM is sending full cycle at 255pwm(5V) , but on 127V the cycle is at 50% which causes my motor to twitch a little bit . How can I solve this ? I am searching for a way to send full PWM cycle even at lower volts . Is it possible ? First I believe you mean D3 not A3 , since PWM does not exist on A3 . Assuming you are driving a DC motor , and not something like a servo or stepper You have two problems . 1st . you may need a smoothing capacitor . Where your formula would be [CODE] Noting that analogWrite uses a [CODE] . The concept is simple , in short the cap average out the high and lows of the PWM , based on the duty cycle . And the capacitance needed is based on the frequency and impedance . This will provide the analog voltage . 2nd . And bigger problem is the output of the Arduino can not supply sufficient current to drive the motor correctly . It will max out at about 20ma , and the motor likely needs more . So at low speeds the pulses which were week , stall out during their low periods . You should have your PWM output drive a transistor , which in turn will ON-OFF the motor directly from the power supply . Now your motor may have enough inertia as not to need the cap . see adafruit-arduino-lesson-13-dc-motors/breadboard -layout and here for a discussion about the smoothing cap",

Unfortunately , that wo n't necessarily cause warnings for code which uses features that were introduced in 10.7 .

Else the call is not executed . This does not happen on IE . OK . Found an answer to one of the questions : The inline mootools request did not execute when declared through the onclick() . It seems this was caused by the script not being synchronous . So probably it returns without actually fully committing the request , and the browser then moves to another page breaking the execution . Adding a synchronous call to the script fixes the problem : [OUTPUT] The second problem that was mentioned on the onmousedownevent , i.e . firefox not executing the ajax call if the browser navigates back is still unsolved . However I am leaving that to be as that was n't the main question raised . Do n't use onclick - very 1995 . Instead attach an event to the element and use event.stop() , ie : [CODE] JS : [CODE] Btw . [CODE] this is not valid in HTML , an ID 'd needs to start with a letter .",

    "text": "the following question may seem stupid to many , since it should have a simple solution , but I am a beginner in the Spring framework , and I have been searching and testing many methods with no success . So , I need to implement logging for a Web Service based on Spring . Maven is used for dependencies , with the spring-boot-starter-ws dependency , and not the whole starter-web starter . I tried with log4j , by adding a dependency and config file , and it does produce a log file , but only for the initialization of the logger itself , and no logging about when the service is used , although log4j is in TRACE level . I also tried with logback , by adding the logback.xml file , and adding the starter-logging dependency , but that also creates empty log files with nothing on them . In the Spring boot documentation , the application.properties file is mentioned . So I created this in WEB-INF , and put the logging.level.org.springframework and the logging.path entries . But still no log file created at all . I do n't want to log my own messages , I just want to log the events generated by Spring itself . And I also do n't have a main method , only an Endpoint for the web service , if any of these might be relevant . So what I need is the simplest possible logging , possibly without adding too many dependencies or so , and retrieve the Spring messages into the log . Can someone tell me what am I doing wrong ? logback is the default logging implementation used by Spring Boot ( I assume you are using spring boot to create a jar and run that ! ) . Basicly you do n't need to do anything logging is already handled by the starter you included . There is a default logback.xml shipped with Spring which turns on logging , for the spring framework this is on INFO . If you want to override this simply create a logback.xml file with the same content as the default one and put the logger for spring on DEBUG or TRACE . Not sure if you really want to put everything on trace unless you want a less performant application . As to what you are doing wrong is that you are probably doing to much and thinking to complex . dont know if logging.level.org.springframework and the logging.path works with spring boot . You can try to move your logback.xml file and application.properties directly to resources dir + paste this to logback.xml [CODE] this should log on console and your /tmp ( if linux ) dir . //Update : to manually set where to write logs you can do something like ( i basically reduced whats inside of base.xml which is imported ) : [CODE] and then change [CODE] to : [CODE]",

    "text": "I am trying to implement an algorithm for process histograms images using multiple threads . One of the most common approach is to split multiple thread create a cache buffer on each one , do the histogram on the cache buffer and then lock a mutex addition the values on the local to the output vector , and unlock the buffer . This approach is very efficient but can introduce a ' jam ' . I mean the additions of the datas cannot be realized concurently . In most of the case when the range of the values is quite short ( e.g . 0-255 ) it 's the time needed to proceed the addition is very fast and can be neglect . If the range of datas is higher like for example on thermal images this time can become more significant . Thermal images are often matrix of unsigned short , even if the values does n't use the full range ( 0-65535 ) the algorithm must process all the range . In order to speed up a little bit hte processing I thought to launch a background thread to do the addition while the \" foreground \" thread would only write the datas into a preallocated buffer . So basically the work of a \" foreground \" thread used to be that : get a buffer from a circular buffer . process the histogram for a specified set of data ( e.g . from line n to line m ) . -notify the background buffer the operations are finished . The background thread used to do : wait until a notification arrive and check if the number of available buffer is lower than the number of buffers . If the conditions are true then look for the buffer to be processed from the buffers available . Do the addition with the output buffer . make the processed buffer reusable . I am not very familiar with condition variables . So in order to check communication between the threads using conditions variable I wrote the following toy sample : toy.h [CODE] main .cpp [CODE] This code as is use to work without difficulties . The unwanted aspect of the code is written on the method background : [CODE] I must check the position of the variable \" it \" otherwise it can take a position outside of the buffer size . The way I thought was : - At the end of the foreground thread a notification is send to the background thread . - Then the background thread process the buffers ( or the buffers depending how fast the threads are ending ) . - At the end the background thread notify to the next foreground thread ( in the method get_buffer()) it has finish to process the buffer and has made it reusable . Following these statement when the background thread is looking for a thread it use to find it between Buf_start and _Buf_end . So the seeking of the buffer in the method background use to be : [CODE] After several hours of tests I have no idea what 's wrong . I am also interested to know if this algorithm really work like I think it do ? Is there any more efficient , less processing way to communicate between threads ? Thanks in advance . I fix it ! :) . I identify several issues from the class \" toy \" . In the overload of the operator [CODE] I copy past the code of the method get buffer() . I did a block function around the wait condition in order to not to be sequential over thread . The [CODE] needed by the condition variable exist only between the brackets of the block function , like this when the wait condition has been evaluated the mutex [CODE] is unlock . Then in order to prevent an outbound during the search of the available buffer the while loop has been replaced by a [CODE] loop . The issue was on the condition to satisfy for increment the pointer . On the \" background \" thread I add a loop . The idea is that : The background thread must run until the end of the end of the algorithm . The background thread is waiting for a notification from one of the foreground thread . Look for a buffer to process , process it , remake it available and notify it to the foreground thread . redo until all the buffers are processed then go back to 2) . Here some part have been \" deeply \" modified . The up to date implementation of the class toy called toy2 is this one : [CODE]",

    "text": "Trying to determine how to take advantage of Angular 's toolset for a problem I 'm trying to solve . My application will be a single page application , but it will also only have one route . There is no other \" state \" as in URL state at all . As far as I can tell , you can take advantage of controllers and views in a 1:1 relationship with a route . What I would like is to have Controller+View combinations for components on the page . ( A component could be a widget , modal window , etc . ) . Is there any way to leverage Angular in this situation ? Note : I have seen https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router , but this still relies heavily on creating \" states \" of the application and tying it to a URL . To include HTML partials , you can use the ng-include directive . This can be coupled with the ng-controller directive in a few different ways : You can nest an element with ng-include inside an ng-controller : [CODE] You can include an ng-controller directive inside an included partial : [CODE] You can also combine ng-include and ng-controller directives on the same element : [CODE] Please note that in each of the examples above , the string literal in the ng-include directive is wrapped in single quotes - this is because the directive expects an expression . Depending on what you 're trying to accomplish , you may need to utilize one or more of these techniques . I also expect you 'll need to work heavily with directives ( for example , you can use the UI Bootstrap modal ) , which can have their own controller as well . I set up a Plunker here with a couple working examples of the ng-include options listed above , including swapping the included template dynamically . I ca n't speak to the feasibility of actually building a production application like this , but it appears to be possible , at least on first glance .",

    "text": "I 'm basically asking which is more costly on the CPU . The situation is that I have about 40-400 particles on the screen at any one given time . Each particle has a List of ParticleAI which have an Update() method that returns a List of newly created Particle objects , if any . Now , since this game is being made for mobile , efficiency on the processor is key . I was wondering if it is more costly to create something between 100-2000 Lists every frame ( at 60FPS ) which may be empty , which is the way I have it now , or to return nulls and do a null check for each AI . For some reason , in my brain it seems constructing a List object would take more processor time than simply returning a null and then doing a boolean check for it . Am I wrong in my assumption ? I have looked at other similar questions , such as this one , but it does n't seem to answer my question . I get that best practice is to return empty , but I am not making this game for anyone else to edit , and so I know that a null will never be received unexpectedly . I need to know in pure processing terms which is better , simply because of the sheer number of particle objects being created at once . Thanks in advance ! EDIT : Just realized something which may work better . Would it be a better idea to ( instead of creating a new list and returning it for every particleAI every frame ) create each particleAI 's return list at construction and then clear it at the beginning of each Update() phase ? That almost seems like it would be the best option . As objects are shared , reusing the same list object will not do . Would involve copying . Null or empty list ? Assuming you want to read from and write to the list , null seems ugly . In java a LinkedList would be lighter that an ArrayList , so pick a linked list . Null would be faster . A read-only , to-be-replaced Collections.emptyList() would be a bit safer . Instead of the data structure of one aspect it might be worthwile considering the algorithmic approach .

    "text": "I was reading an article linked from a slashdot story , and came across this little tidbit : [OUTPUT] I 've scoured the internet ( okay , I spent at least 15 minutes googling variations on \" java question mark \" ) and got nothing . So , my question : is there any official documentation on this ? I found that C# has a similar operator ( the \" [CODE] \" operator ) , but I 'd like to get the documentation for the language I 'm working in . Or , is this just a use of the ternary operator that I 've never seen before . Thanks ! EDIT : Link to the article : http://infoworld.com/d/developer-world/12-programming-mistakes-avoid-292 The original idea comes from groovy . It was proposed for Java 7 as part of Project Coin : https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Coin/2009+Proposals+TOC ( Elvis and Other Null-Safe Operators ) , but has n't been accepted yet . The related Elvis operator [CODE] was proposed to make [CODE] shorthand for [CODE] , especially useful when x is a complex expression . I 'm not sure this would even work ; if , say , the person reference was null , what would the runtime replace it with ? A new Person ? That would require the Person to have some default initialization that you 'd expect in this case . You may avoid null reference exceptions but you 'd still get unpredictable behavior if you did n't plan for these types of setups . The [CODE] operator in C# might be best termed the \" coalesce \" operator ; you can chain several expressions and it will return the first that is n't null . Unfortunately , Java does n't have it . I think the best you could do is use the ternary operator to perform null checks and evaluate an alternative to the entire expression if any member in the chain is null : [CODE] You could also use [CODE] : [CODE]",

    "text": "[OUTPUT] My question is : Which is better between using NotificationCenter and using Closures to communicate between two instances ? If they are similar , what should I use ? Hopefully , this example helps you to understand better : - If we take URLSession class as an example . Why do most of its methods have a closure ? Why do not they send a notification with Data , Response , and Error inside it ? I know the difference between them , I just do n't know in what situations should I use each one . In some cases the patterns are interchangeable , however : Using a closure is the simplest solution for simple cases Using a delegate is common when there is complex communication between two objects . One delegate can be better than many closures . You have to use notifications when you have multiple observers or when you are not sure what objects will be observing . You might be asking yourself why we are using closures for simple cases and not delegates or notifications . The answer is that closures are the most lightweight . They are easy to create and they positively affect your code quality . Let 's consider a completion callback . If you decide to use a notification , you need another method that will handle that notification . The same is valid for delegates . If you need some context ( e.g . the parameters that triggered the actions ) , you will need to save it into a property . On the other hand , a closure can be created inline . That means that the code that triggers the action and handles its result is at one place . This really simplifies the structure of your code . Also note that if the closure needs some context , it can capture it , without the need to create an additional property .",

If anyone has a better way I would appreciate it . Original : I created a class that extends MPxCommand to create a plug-in and have been trying to figure out how to parse the MArgList in the doIt() function to pull a couple of lists from from the args variable . I am trying to pull a list of strings and a list ints that will have an inconsistent length so I wo n't be able to ( I think ) fill the flag multiple times when I call the command . I 've had success pulling individual variables with MArgParser but have not found a way to pull a full list . MArgList appears to have what I want with the function asStringArray(index) and asIntArray(index) but when I use try using them I get the error : [CODE] Edit : [CODE] This code will put \" hello \" from the args into self.myStr if I run [CODE] [CODE] , but I 'd like to be able to be able to run [CODE] [CODE] and be able to get the array from the args variable and put it into self.myStr .

I think your problem is in the declaration of that function : [CODE] int & is a reference to an int , i.e . an int you give to the function , the function will change it , and your variable will reflect the changes . So maybe you already see it : passing a constant is not possible .

At first i thought it must be on error on my side ( i use UiBinder with some custom css ) but then I noticed that on the GWT showcases site the various widget fonts are also too big . Any ideas ? This is due to IE default font size rendering and has nothing to do with GWT but rather with CSS styling . You can ensure that fonts are consistent over multiple browser with a CSS like that ( for instance ) : [CODE] EDIT : To ensure all widgets \" get \" this new style you need to put your CSS file in the * .gwt.xml file in the following way ( the order of lines is important ) : [CODE] do n't put it in the HTML page !

I 'm not sure if that 's GWT 's fault - every browser has some core CSS rules defining the default look , if no additional CSS styles are applied ( like that annoying blue border on all images in FF ) , so just make sure you set explicitly your font size , etc to nullify these differences . That is , unless you are seeing fonts way larger than they should be - then it might be a bug .

    "text": "For my experiment I need to define specific similarity metrics for each field of my collection documents . For example , I need to measure the Description field similarity with tf.idf , and Geolocation fields with Harvesine distance. . etc .. . I 'm now studying the Similarity class . I was wondering if there is any good tutorial or example about this to procede faster .. . thanks EDIT : IIUC , you have a similarity formula per field , and you want to use it per document , running against all other documents . You can use several options , all at indexing time : Extend the DefaultSimilarity class . Extend the SimilarityDelegator class , if you only need to modify part of the methods . In both methods , you may make use of payloads to store term-specific information ( could be useful for the lat-long data ) . After implementing a Similarity class using one of these methods , use Similarity.setDefault(mySimilarity) to set this as the Similarity instance for indexing and searching . Only then index your text corpus , which you can search later - you will probably have to extend the Searcher class as well to get the raw similarity . Having said that , I believe this approach is wrong for your use case - Lucene is optimized to get a few similar documents , not a score for every one , so I predict the runtime will be prohibitive - Hope I am wrong , but nevertheless I suggest you read Mining of Massive Datasets for a better approach - min hashes and shingling . Good luck . Patrick , I will first quote Grant Ingersoll about modifying the Similarity class : \" Here be Dragons \" . Customizing Lucene 's Similarity class is hard . I have done this . It is not fun . Only do this if you absolutely have to . I suggest you should first read Grant 's spatial search paper , his findability paper and his ' debugging relevance ' paper . These show other ways to get hits as needed .",

    "text": "I am doing some research into the Memento Pattern and I am generally new to behavioural patterns and with my research I have been getting pretty confused . One of the main things I have been getting confused on is the differences between the Memento Pattern and Serialization . From what I can gather both can be used to store objects and have them brought back at a later date but I have not been able to find a clear cut answer on what the key differences between them are , maybe I have missed something in my research but I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on what the differences are between the two . Thanks Typically the Memento pattern is used to implement roll-back/save point support . For example I might want to mark the state of an object at a point in time , do some work and then decide to revert that object back to the point at which is was marked . The implementation of a Memento pattern could use serialisation , which would involve saving the contents of the object into a byte[] and keeping in memory or writing to disk . When reverting the content of the object would be rebuilt from the serialised copy . Conversely I could implement a Memento pattern by cloning the object in memory and keeping a reference to the copy and then copying the state back if the object needs reverting . This method does n't use serialisation . The Memento pattern is an OO design pattern used to keep previous states of an object in memory . It 's useful to implement an \" Undo \" operation , for example . Serialization is the process of transforming a graph of objects to a byte array , in order to save it on disk , or send it to another JVM over the network , for example . They do n't have much in common .",

    "text": "I found that std::condition_variable is very difficult to use due to spurious wakeups . So sometimes I need to set a flags such as : [CODE] I set is_ready to true before I call notify ( notify_one() or notify_all()) , and then I wait : [CODE] Is there any reason that I should n't just do this : ( Edit : Ok , this is really a bad idea . ) [CODE] And if condition_variable had chosen a waiting duration ( I do n't know whether this is true or not ) , I prefer choose it myself . The purpose of std::condition_variable is to wait for some condition to become true . It is not designed to be just a receiver of a notify . You might use it , for example , when a consumer thread needs to wait for a queue to become non-empty . [CODE] The consumer ( get_from_queue ) is not waiting for the condition variable , they are waiting for the condition the_queue.empty() . The condition variable gives you the way to put them to sleep while they are waiting , simultaneously releasing the mutex and doing so in a way that avoids race conditions where you miss wake ups . The condition you are waiting on should be protected by a mutex ( the one you release when you wait on the condition variable . ) This means that the condition rarely ( if ever ) needs to be an atomic . You are always accessing it from within a mutex . You can code this either way : Using atomics and a polling loop . Using a condition_variable . I 've coded it both ways for you below . On my system I can monitor in real time how much cpu any given process is using . First with the polling loop : [CODE] For me this takes 30 seconds to execute , and while executing the process takes about 99.6 % of a cpu . Alternatively with a condition_variable : [CODE] This has the exact same behavior except that during the 30 second execution , the process is taking 0.0 % cpu . If you 're writing an app that might execute on a battery powered device , the latter is nearly infinitely easier on the battery . Now admittedly , if you had a very poor implementation of std::condition_variable , it could have the same inefficiency as the polling loop . However in practice such a vendor ought to go out of business fairly quickly . Update For grins I augmented my condition_variable wait loop with a spurious wakeup detector . I ran it again , and it did not print out anything . Not one spurious wakeup . That is of course not guaranteed . But it does demonstrate what a quality implementation can achieve .",

    "text": "Overview : I have written an application that allows a user to define a query , submit it to a server and view the results . The software can run on DB2 or MySQL . Problem : We 've had issues in the DB2 version where a user has tried to run a query , and found that it has failed because their user profile has been disabled . In order to run a query on DB2 ( on an IBM i) , the user 's profile name and password are provided in the connection string . Security on the server can specify that a user 's profile is disabled after two or three incorrect logins . Question : I 've debugged the application and found that the problem is down to the query being submitted twice . If the user 's password is wrong , then of course , this is having the knock-on effect of disabling their profile . On further inspection , when I 've inspected the logs on the server ( while debugging line by line ) , I 've found that the query is submitted to the server when you call TADOQuery.sql.add() , and again when the TADOQuery 's active propery is set to true ( which is the point at which I would expect the query to be submitted to the server ) . Here 's an example of the code that I 'm using to run the query : [CODE] My question is therefore quite simple : 1 . Why does the TADOQuery.sql.add() method submit the query ( when it should just be adding the sql to the TADOQuery 's sql property ) ? 2 . What can I do to prevent this ? i.e . is there any way to prevent the sql being submitted when I call the add() method ? For those of you that would like extra information about the logs , the exit point logs on the IBM i show that when I call adoqry.sql.add in the above example , the query is run through the \" Database Server-SQL Requests \" exit point application , via function \" Prepare and Describe \" . When I call [CODE] in the above example , the same query goes through the same exit point application , but via the \" Open/Describe \" function . If you 're not familiar with the IBM i , do n't worry about it - I 'm just including that information as proof that I have traced the query being submitted twice . The real issue is with the TADOQuery 's sql.add() processing . From your description of your problem , I assume you specify the ConnectionString of the ADOQuery . Doing this combines the database login with the running of the query . You have found that this has undesirable side effects when the user 's credentials are invalid . Separate the database login from the query by using an ADOConnection . Specify the ConnectionString of the ADOConnection and assign the ADOConnection to the ADOQuery.Connection property . This way , you control the database login and can catch logins with bad credentials . Additionally the ADOConnection.Open method allows you to specify the username and password so you do not have to put them in the ConnectionString . While this does not answer you specific questions , this approach will help you solve the problem of the user 's profile being disabled by separating the login from the running of the query .",

This becomes 0 + 255 = 255 and the carry flag is not set , even though [CODE] . I came across this same issue in other Z80 documents as well , so I do n't believe this is a typo . Am I misunderstanding how borrow and [CODE] work or is there something else going on ? Is [CODE] not equal to [CODE] with two 's complement in terms of flags ? The GameBoy CPU manual has it backwards . [CODE] , [CODE] and [CODE] all set the carry flag when there is borrow . If [CODE] is executed then carry is set if [CODE] otherwise it is clear .

    "text": "Sorry I will rewrite the question hoping to be clear . In my .cpp code I create a list of quads , a few of them have a flag , in the pixel shader I check if this flag is set or not , if the flag is not set , the quad gets colored in red for example , if the flag is set , I want to decide the color of every single pixel , so if I need to colour half of the flagged quad in red and the other half in blue I can simply do something like : [CODE] In this way I can get half of the quad colored in blue and another half colored in red , or I can decide where to put the red color or where to put the blue one . Imagine I 've got a quad 50x50 pixels [ frag ] [CODE] In this case I would expect that a quad with the flag set will get two colors per face . I hope I have been more specific now . thanks . Just to add something I ca n't use any texture . Ok i do this now : Every quad has 4 textures coordinated ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 1) , ( 1 , 1) , ( 1 , 0 ) ; I enable the texture coordinates using : [CODE] [ vert ] [CODE] [ frag ] [CODE] I get always the yellow color so [CODE] and [CODE] almost always and some quad is yellow/green . I would expect that the texture coordinates change in the fragment shader and so I should get a gradient , am I wrong ? In addition to Chris Dodd 's answer , you can also access the screen-space coordinate ( in pixels , though actually pixel centers and thus ? . 5) of the currently processed fragment through the special fragment shader variable gl_FragCoord : [CODE] But this gives you the position of the fragment in screen-space and thus relative to the lower left corner of you viewport . If you actually need to know the position inside the individual quad ( which makes more sense if you want to actually color each quad half-by-half , since the \" half-cut \" would otherwise vary with the quad 's position ) , then Chris Dodd 's answer is the correct approach . If you want to know the coordinate within the quad , you need to calculate it yourself . In order to that , you 'll need to create a new interpolant ( call it something like [CODE] ) , and set it appropriately for each vertex , which means you 'll likely also need to add it as an attribute and pass it through your vertex shader . eg : [CODE] You 'll need to feed in this attribute in your drawing code when drawing your quads . For each quad , the vertexes will have likely have quadCoordIn values of ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 1) , ( 1 , 1) and ( 1 , 0 ) - - you could use some other coordinate system if you prefer , but this is the easiest . Then , in your fragment program , you can access quadCoord.xy to determine where in the quad you are .",

    "text": "i have a csv file with comments , the values of which need to be split between two ArrayLists . eg : [CODE] what is the best way of achieving this ? should i use a counter that is incremented each time the state changes from [CODE] to a value or vice versa and then [CODE] then add a new ArrayList and start writing to that ? thats the only way i can think to do it , but it seems a little bit clumsy , does anyone else have a better idea ? EDIT : i have already written the code for actually parsing the csv values , i dont need help with that , just wondering about how to split the values into two lists. . Your suggestion sounds good to me . If the file format is really so predictable , any more sophisticated approaches might just be overkill in my opinion . But if you want to see a different approach , this is my idea : Every line that does not start with an [CODE] is something we want to parse to an ArrayList . So , whenever you come across a line that is not a comment , you start parsing the following lines to an ArrayList until you either hit another comment or the end of the file . Both options mark the end of the part that you want to store in one single ArrayList . So , something like this : [CODE] where [CODE] returns a boolean that indicates whether the given line is a comment , and [CODE] uses your method to parse a line of numbers and stores them in the provided list .",

    "text": "I have 2 FileHandlers that write out to two separate files , and the amount of I/O occurring is slowing down my application quite a bit : I 've decided to have the FileHandlers run on separate threads . As they are on separate threads , I needed a concept of a \" queue \" , so that these separate threads can poll this queue and print out any incoming messages . I 've preformatted messages so that any arguments used do not change before they actually reach the print out in the FileHandler . Now I 've realised that I ca n't use the \" log \" methods provided by the logger , as that attempts to invoke methods on the current thread to format and print out the messages . So I simply call a method that adds my trace message to the queue . I then use run() method of the FileHandlers to print out the messages using publish() . I now realise publish() only takes in a LogRecord , which is just a level + message . My traces have much more , which ca n't simply be placed in an overall message , I want to be able to use the \" Formatter \" that I 've set to the FileHandler . So I create an instance of the logger in the FileHandler , so I can use the log method and format the string as designed in the Formatter . Which works , kinda . .. . This is getting a bit silly , is it worth continuing on like this , working AROUND the java.util.Logger rather than working with it ? One of the useful parts of the java.util.Logger is having a separate logger instance for each class and being able to have more control over the messages .. . Any suggestions ? The code is quite long , but I think it 's easily understood from the description above , if not let me know and I 'll upload somewhere . You can use log4j 2 JDK Logging Adapter to enable logging with log4j , And log4j 2 provide remarkable asynchronous Logging mechanism with lot of configuration options . Necessary VM arguments [CODE] You can find more information about log4j 2 async logging here and tomcat configuration details here sample Log4j2.xml for async loggign [CODE] You should really consider using SLF4J . These issues you are describing come along with rolling your own logger . SLF4J is really commonly used because it is not very intrusive , should you decide that you need something different you can swap it out for a different framework . http://saltnlight5.blogspot.ca/2013/08/how-to-configure-slf4j-with-different.html http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html If you do decide to stick with your own logger I would say that you should start by making it a singleton with several logwriters attached to log levels , you then setup a non-blocking queue for each logger ( there are tons of examples of this out there ) and simply call log(logLevel, logOrigin, logMessage) and under the hood send this to each logwriter , which would be a non-blocking queue that runs on a thread for each logwriter . Each logwriter should be it 's own thread , not each log , and you only need one logger as all it is is a short hand to place things in your logwriter 's queues from anywhere in your app .",

    "text": "I 'm using an AVAssetReaderOutput to read samples from an AVAsset , do some processing on them , and play the result using a RemoteIO AU . The problem is that after calling AudioOutputUnitStop to pause the playback , then after going to the background and back to the foreground the audio wo n't start again after calling AudioOutputUnitStart . This is due to an error returned from the copyNextSampleBuffer method of AVAssetReaderOutput , which is called as part of the rendering pipeline . The status property of AVAssetReader after calling copyNextSampleBuffer is AVAssetReaderStatusFailed , and its error property is [OUTPUT] I 'm looking for a solution which wo n't force me to reinitialize the entire pipeline after coming back to the foreground - Hoping there is such a solution , that AVAssetReaders can survive the app going to background and back. . Notes The app is entitled to play audio in the background . I 'm handling audio interruptions - Setting my AVAudioSession as the active one both on AVAudioSessionDelegates endInterruptionWithFlags : event and whenever the app becomes active . Does n't make a difference whether I do this or not , getting the same error . Some code : AudioPlayer [CODE] AudioReader Setup [CODE] AudioReader Render Method , called eventually by the RenderCallback function [CODE] The graph and AVReader underpinnings are not connected/linked whatsoever . The confusion perhaps comes from that iOS wo n't \" background \" ( hibernate ) a process if it sees the audio graph running ( because then audio data would be unable to be generated ) . That 's why when you stop the audio graph , 2-3 minutes later , iOS will background your process ( as of iOS 9 ) . Presumably , iOS looks at what 's going on in your process and decides when your process should be forced to background ( via [CODE] ) . Apple devs decided for whatever reason to make AVReader stop when put into background mode ( my best guess is QA ) . The good news is that you can detect it and recover when your process exits background mode , but you WILL need to restart your reader and readerOutput again . First , when AVAssetReaderOutput 's copyNextSampleBuffer returns NULL , check AVAssetReader.error.code for AVErrorOperationInterrupted . The way we pull off a gapless recovery here is when we get to that point , we first calculate the exact time we left off at ( easy to do - - just maintain a counter of the total samples already output ) . Then , you WILL need to restart your AVAssetReader and AVAssetReaderOutput flow . But that 's no problem since your good development practices would have encapsulated that in a single function that has a seek time as an argument . In that function , use AVAssetReader.timeRange to seek to that time you need to resume at and presto ! There first thing I would try is : Not calling AudioOutputUnitStop ? Why do n't you leave the graph running and when the audio is paused simply not call [CODE] Instead just fill the buffer with 0 's and/or use a render action of kAudioUnitRenderAction_OutputIsSilence for the buffers . Starting and stopping the graph takes time and leads to an unresponsive graph . I never stop the graph while my apps are running . ( Unless some serious interruption happens ) This may keep the asset reader around and happy . But I have a hunch that as the AVAssetReader is not directly connected to the audio graph ( you just happen to request samples and place them in the buffer supplied by the render callback ) the problem does not lie with the audio graph being stopped and restarted at all . So the next line of attack I would try is to request samples from an AVAsset , put the app into the background and bring it back to the foreground without using an AUGraph at all . This will determine if the problem is related to the AUGraph or the app entering a background state . If something happens that forces you to tear down your AVAssetReader you will have to reconnect to the asset . So as you have to write that code another the option I would look at is the one you do n't want to do . Reconnect to the AVAssetReader , seek to the position you left off at and keep going .",

The third option means that the \" begin \" and \" end \" commands must be run from the same folder , e.g . the current folder should be the same when running the commands ( if you execute [CODE] before the scanner commands the printed paths should be the same ) . Edit : This particular problem seems to be caused because the build is executing older version of MSBuild . Please , make sure that you run MSBuild 14 or 15 in your analysis builds . Older suggestion ( still generally valid ) We just investigated similar problem which is caused by the user the Slave Agent service is authenticated with . To check if yours is the same , run the [CODE] step of the scanner with [CODE] and in the output you should see lines like these : [CODE] If the paths at the end are subfolders of C:\\Windows then you need to change the Jenkins slave agent 's Windows Service user with a domain user ( and not Local System ) :",

So the file is like : [CODE] The data contains integer , pointer , double value and so on . I found python can not even handle this situation . There is no problem if I read the whole file in memory . It 's fast . But it seems the struct package is not good at performance . It almost stuck on unpack the bytes . Any help is appreciated . Thanks . struct and array , which other answers recommend , are fine for the details of the implementation , and might be all you need if your needs are always to sequentially read all of the file or a prefix of it . Other options include buffer , mmap , even ctypes , depending on many details you do n't mention regarding your exact needs . Maybe a little specialized Cython-coded helper can offer all the extra performance you need , if no suitable and accessible library ( in C , C++ , Fortran , .. . ) already exists that can be interfaced for the purpose of handling this humongous file as you need to . But clearly there are peculiar issues here - - how can a data file contain pointers , for example , which are intrinsically a concept related to addressing memory ? Are they maybe \" offsets \" instead , and , if so , how exactly are they based and coded ? Are your needs at all more advanced than simply sequential reading ( e.g . , random access ) , and if so , can you do a first \" indexing \" pass to get all the offsets from start of file to start of record into a more usable , compact , handily-formatted auxiliary file ? ( That binary file of offsets would be a natural for array - - unless the offsets need to be longer than array supports on your machine ! ) . What is the distribution of record lengths and compositions and number of records to make up the \" tens of gigabytes \" ? Etc , etc . You have a very large scale problem ( and no doubt very large scale hardware to support it , since you mention that you can easily read all of the file into memory that means a 64bit box with many tens of GB of RAM - - wow ! ) , so it 's well worth the detailed care to optimize the handling thereof - - but we ca n't help much with such detailed care unless we know enough detail to do so ! - ) .

    "text": "I am trying to create thread library.For this I am trying to implement queue to store the pending threads to be executed . [CODE] The reason I mentioned the queue because i tried experimenting by removing below code from ' MyThreadYield ' function and it workes fine but doesnt do the intended functionality . getcontext(&(save.context)) ; addToQueue(save) ; For one , your queue implementation is not thread-safe at this point . Your question strongly suggests that this code will be used in a multi-threaded environment . Having a non thread-safe queue will give you wrong results , and weird things can happen ( like removeFromQueue() returning the same thing to two different threads , or addToQueue() inserting two items in the same position ) . Aside from that , your queue implementation would never work . You are not using front and rear correctly . Look carefully at the insert function : [CODE] You check if rear is MAX , yet , you write into queue[front] and increment front . What if I just keep adding items to the queue , eventually reaching the buffer 's limit ? rear will always be 0 , front will grow indefinitely , and your function will write beyond the limits of queue . That 's probably the cause of your segmentation fault errors . I think you wanted to check for front instead : [CODE] The code for removeFromQueue() looks superficially ok , as long as queue is a global array ( since you 're returning a pointer , and ca n't return pointers to local variables ) . However , the single , most important fact you have to take out of this answer , is that your queue implementation will not scale in the long-term . An array-based queue is a terrible choice . What do you do when you run out of space in the array ? What if I insert MAX elements , then remove 2 or 3 , and try to insert more ? Your code will say the queue is full , because it only ever allows you to insert MAX elements in total . You could shift every element in the queue to the left when an element is removed , but that 's crazy , and extremely inefficient . Or you could increment front modulo MAX , allowing rear to be ahead of front , as long as you know that no more than MAX elements can be inserted . That would be better , but it would break the logic in removeFromQueue() , since the pointers returned earlier will possibly point to a different thread struct as you manipulate the queue - total disaster . Definitely not what you want . A much , much better approach would be to implement this with a linked list where you keep a pointer to the head and a pointer to the tail .

I want the links at the bottom of the items to be at the same position , like this : But actual it looks like this : I used JavaScript to set those items to the same height , but how can I get theese links to the same position ? I know this can be done by setting the item to [CODE] and the a to [CODE] but then [CODE] does n't work anymore . I made a JSFiddle for you to understand my problem . Hope you can help me . Since you asked for a solution without [CODE] I give you the following approach . What you can do is that you wrap up your content containers into another div-container and insert the link after your content container . You would get a pseudo structure like that : [CODE] For every three of your content containers . Working with your javascript resizeFunction the links are on the same height all the time . Note that your [CODE] is [CODE] now , but your [CODE] are not . Greetz Flex can do this very easily but with some what less browser support . Another way is using [CODE] , which have very good support ( down to IE8 ) , at the end you find a sample using that . One more way , thinking in the terms of \" rows \" , is like this , where there is no absolute position , no script and keep your links at the bottom , all centered . Update As requested , and to make it more responsive , I added a media query . Run the snippet in full page and resize the browser to see it in action . To be noted though , this is still a \" without using flex \" solution . Update 2 Added a [CODE] [CODE] [CODE] The table version [CODE] [CODE]",

Well , one way is to assume that all the cycles with that code are complete and just enumerate the records by col6 , col5 . This additional cycle sequence number is then used for aggregation .

Although a pivot can be used in this case , I think the aggregation method might be a bit clearer : [CODE] The Query : [CODE] The Output : [CODE] You can choose which columns you require and which columns to remove in your final select .

I feel it must be obvious , but I ca n't figure it out . Start your debugging session normally . Then once it is started , use Visual Studio , File/Open menu to open the correct .cs file . If you have a corresponding .pdb file for the dll in which the file is included you will be able to set breakpoints which will be hit in your debugging session . If you do n't have the pdb file , this means your dll was compiled in Release configuration rather than debug configuration . During this session you may need to open other .cs files manually as you step into statements . Open the needed files before you step into them . Prior to running the projects ( F 5) and if you have the C# code ( rather than just the PDB ) you can open up the .cs file using File->Open and set breakpoints . If you do n't have the .cs then can use something like reflector to generate the .cs files for you .

First , some functions that really help in a toolbox : [CODE] And then you can rewrite the code quite efficiently ( no extra memory allocation ) and with more readability too : [CODE] Which wo n't help much for the actual question since you 're not showing the code producing the error .",

    "text": "I 'm running the OpenTok demo WebRTC app on Chrome - and it works great . But if I load the page in IE , it gives me an error message ( about page compatibility ) . Pretty obvious solution is to use the old ( Flash-based ) OpenTok library on IE - but do I have to do it \" manually \" ? Is there some sort of an \" automatic switching \" library that would try to load WebRTC ( 2.0 ) TB.min.js , and if it fails fall back to Flash ( 0.9 ) version ? Also a related question - will all these versions interoperate ? I.e . can Chromes ( running 2.0/WebRTC ) talk to IE ( running 0.9/Flash ) and talk to iOS ( running native ) ? To have WebRTC capabilities on IE , users could install Chrome Frame ( for IE6+ ) . It is a valid option , but you should know that it is no longer being actively supported by Google . As far as I know , there is no automatic switching library . However , on your server , you could look at the HTTP requests and find out the client 's browser . From there , you could dynamically load either the WebRTC or Flash library depending on the browser 's support for WebRTC . Currently , the OpenTok WebRTC library supports : Chrome 23+ Firefox 22+ Unfortunately , OpenTok does not interoperate between Flash and WebRTC clients . WebRTC clients can operate with other WebRTC clients ( mobile , web , etc . ) , just like Flash can only operate with other Flash clients . For example , an iOS client would have to use the WebRTC SDK and the Chrome/Firefox web app would have to include the WebRTC Javascript library .",

It appears the Nios II architecture does n't have atomic test-and-set instructions . Instead for synchronization of shared resources between multiple Nios II processors , the architecture uses an \" Hardware Mutex Core \" . It works as a shared peripheral that provides an atomic test-and-test operation . You can read more about it in Altera 's Creating Multiprocessor Nios II Systems Tutorial .

    "text": "I 'm new to programming and today I 'm here because I need help with a simple exercise that I 'm trying to solve . The exercise consists of various small parts : 1) Define a struct called Point with two x and y coordinates ( double ) . 2) Prompt the user to enter 7 ( x , y ) pairs . 3) As we read those pairs we have to store them in a vector of Points called original_points . So this is my first attempt : [CODE] If a simple format error occurs , I try to recover by skipping every character until the program reaches a ' ( ' . My problem is that if I try to enter a wrong input format such as : 9 , 99 ) the code will push_back() both the first correct reading after the error and also the first one before the error occurred . So for example if I try to input such data : ( 1 , 2) 9 , 99 ) ( 5 , 6 ) I will have three elements in my vector : ( 1 , 2) , ( 1 , 2) again , and ( 5 , 6 ) . It seems like when I get into the loop after every condition check the value of P remains the same instead of creating a new Point object for every iteration . Could you help me please with this problem ? Why is this error occurring ? Thank you There are multiple things here that are not ok . First of all , you do n't initialize the Point , so it has some random data . The random data is not so random , because in the loop the memory allocation is always the same , so the variable will have the data of the last loop . In [CODE] here you have a \" return is \" , if the first char is not a ' ( ' so you jump out of there without setting p.x and p.y . The function skip_to_character(...) is another thing that is n't ok , besides the fact that it is hard to read and a really bad way to use a [CODE] loop , there wo n't be a ' C ' when you enter \" 9 , 99 ) \" so i guess here you get the \" No input \" output . And now to the [CODE] loop in you main : Here is what happens : you create a Point p without initializing it your read garbage out of the stream and p wo n't be set you skip garbage you push your uninitialized Point p into the vector If you do n't believe me that there is no data in p . Try to initialize it with 0 or something else and check the output : [CODE]",

    "text": "I have a model that needs to be saved in to a MongoDB collection . To get the collection name I have two options before me . 1) Attribute I decorate the class with a custom attribute and use reflection to access the value inside it . I can then cache this with the type to avoid future lookups . [CODE] 2) Static Property Here I have a static property in the class that contains the collection name . [CODE] I find that I am inclined to go with the former as it looks and feels cleaner but some of the senior devs here are turning their nose up at the use of reflection . Is there a case to be made for the first option or is it just better to go with option 2 ? This is a clear case of metadata vs . data : Option 1 : Attributes are supposed to hold metadata about the entities they are attached to . Option 2 : member fields and properties , regardless if instance or static , are supposed to hold data that make up the integral value of the class . Hence , option 1 , attributes , is the right approach to represent metadata . Usage of reflection is a mere technicality and can be encapsulated into a separate class , e.g . an AttributeManager , that would ease access to metadata and cache them appropriately to avoid performance overhead ( should that be an issue in a particular case ) .",

    "text": "I 'm at a client site where they have an application which began in SharePoint and is slowly migrating away to a very custom ASP.NET application . Some of their data elements are still hosted within SharePoint lists , two of which currently in question are some \" Notes \" and \" Tasks \" ( fairly simple data elements in their SharePoint setup , nothing special about them ) . One of the things I need to be able to do from within ASP.NET is to automatically create some new items for these lists and add them from code . So far it 's pretty easy . I found the existing web part which handled the editing for those items , attached the debugger to it , tracked how it got its values and what it added to the list , etc . However , one of the fields being added to the list item is n't quite as obvious . In the existing web part UI , the field looks like this : Essentially , it 's a field for entering a user from the current Windows domain . The book icon opens a pop-up which allows the user to search for a name , etc . In my current testing , I 'm running as local Administrator on a development machine . So I just look for \" admin \" in the pop-up and it populates the field with \" [ machine name ] \\Administrator \" as expected . Then , in debugging , the value that gets pulled from the field and entered into the SharePoint list item is \" 1 \" as opposed to a name or anything like that . I assume that \" 1 \" is an identifier for the local admin account . Makes sense , after all . But my question is , how can I get that identifier for the current logged-in user in code ? I 've found code to get the current user 's name , but not any kind of numeric ( even though it 's a string ) ID . Additionally , this would n't just be happening inside of an ASP.NET application context . There 's also a WPF client application for laptops which would be generating these list items and synchronizing them back to the server when connected . I 'm currently operating on the assumption that the client user would be logged in with a proper domain account known to the server . I imagine this is pretty easy , I just have n't stumbled across what I need quite yet . I suppose you 're looking for this : [CODE] By the way , this is the internal Id assigned by SharePoint to the user . To get this Id from a WPF application , you could deploy a WebService inside SharePoint that would return this Id . Or you can even query the SharePoint database , but I 'm not sure if it 's safe :-)",

So , I removed the [CODE] from the id section of your code and now it works . Solution : [CODE] and [CODE] You do not need to add [CODE] to id of register_sidebars . Please read the codex , it says : \" [CODE] \" is added automatically to supplied ' id ' value after the first ; e.g . , \" Sidebar-1 \" , \" Sidebar-2 \" , \" Sidebar-3 \" , etc .",

    "text": "I 'm using .NET entity framework 4.1 with code-first approach to effectively solve the following problem , here simplified . There 's a database table with tens of thousands of entries . Several users of my program need to be able to View the ( entire ) table in a GridRow , which implied that the entire Table has to be downloaded . Modify values of any random row , changes are frequent but need not be persisted immediately . It 's expected that different users will modify different rows , but this is not always true . Some loss of changes is permitted , as users will most likely update same rows to same values . On occasion add new rows . Sounds simple enough . My initial approach was to use a long-running DbContext instance . This one DbContext was supposed to track changes to the entities , so that when SaveChanges() is called , most of the legwork is done automatically . However many have pointed out that this is not an optimal solution in the long run , notably here . I 'm still not sure if I understand the reasons , and I do n't see what a unit-of-work is in my scenario either . The user chooses herself when to persist changes , and let 's say that client always wins for simplicity . It 's also important to note that objects that have not been touched do n't overwrite any data in the database . Another approach would be to track changes manually or use objects that track changes for me , however I 'm not too familiar with such techniques , and I would welcome a nudge in the right direction . What 's the correct way to solve this problem ? I understand that this question is a bit wishy-washy , but think of it as more fundamental . I lack fundamental understanding about how to solve this class of problems . It seems to me that long living DbContext is the right way , but knowledgeable people tell me otherwise , which leads me to confusion and imprecise questions . EDIT1 Another point of confusion is the existance of Local property on the DbSet <> object . It invites me to use a long running context , as another user has posted here . Sounds to me like your users could have a copy ( cached ) of the data for an indefinate period of time . The longer the users are using cached data the greater the odds that they could become disconnected from the database connection in DbContext . My guess is EF does n't handle this well and you probably want to deal with that . ( e.g . occaisionally connected architecture ) . I would expect implementing that may solve many of your issues . Problem with long running context is that it does n't refresh data - I more discussed problems here . So if your user opens the list and modify data half an hour she does n't know about changes . But in case of WPF if your business action is : Open the list Do as many actions as you want Trigger saving changes Then this whole is unit of work and you can use single context instance for that . If you have scenario where last edit wins you should not have problems with this until somebody else deletes record which current user edits . Additionally after saving or cancelling changes you should dispose current context and load data again - this will ensure that you really have fresh data for next unit of work . Context offers some features to refresh data but it only refreshes data previously loaded ( without relations ) so for example new unsaved records will be still included . Perhaps you can also read about MS Sync framework and local data cache .",

In the end I took another approach ; instead of trying to stop the user from dragging ANY of the child control outside of the boundary of the container I have only stopped them from dragging the pointer outside the boundary , e.g . in the mousemove eventhandler : [CODE] The problem with this was that the parts of the child control were visible outside of the container . What I did was set the Clip property of the parent control so that the parts of the child outside of the boundary are hidden . e.g . : [CODE] This seems to work quite nicely ! This is no way other than checking each corner of the control . However , you can take some shortcuts as you know that Dialog and what you are dragging it over wo n't change shape or size during the drag and that it 's impossible for the left hand edge of Dialog to be to the right of the right hand edge of Grid without the right hand edge of Dialog also being to the right of Grid .

    "text": "I am performing a custom traversal in Neo4J , using my own evaluator . In the traversal are two nodes , connected by two different relationships . What I 'm seeing is that only one of the two relationships will be walked during the traversal . However , my custom evaluation changes its behavior based on whether both relationships are present . It seems like during a traversal , Neo4J maintains a set of visited nodes , and if a candidate path ends at a node that has already been visited , then that path is never sent to my evaluator . Is there a way around this ? How can I have a custom evaluator examine every possible path to the nodes ? Here 's a quick example : Say that the graph looks like this : [CODE] The traversal begins at A . A has two different relationships tying it to B ( of two different types ) . All of the remaining nodes are connected by only 1 relationship . The goal of the evaluator is to return A-D , A-B , and B-C , but not D-E . The determination that B-C is valid comes from the fact that there are two relationships between A and B . How can this be solved ? You may need to think your use case through a bit more carefully . One suggestion is that when you use the traversal framework in java , basically you can build a TraversalDescription and then iterate through what comes back from it by relationships , rather than by Paths or by Nodes . If your primary complaint is that each node is visited only once , you can change the TraversalDescription to specify RELATIONSHIP_GLOBAL guaranteeing that all relationships will be followed , whether or not that causes you to hit a node more than once . More broadly , traversers do n't tend to go over the same material more than once because if they did , you 'd need to be ultra careful about specifying a termination condition . If hitting certain nodes or relationships more than once is OK , when do you know that you 're done ?",

But then say I need to go back to Qt Designer and update the layout of the GUI . Is there a way to compile that and then update the original .py file with the changes rather than having to manually copy/paste my custom code ? Personally I hate compiling it . But like ekhumoro said , you can import the class . I still dislike this though . pyuic sometimes imports nasty example_rc things , which lowers productivity levels again . If you absolutely must transform .ui to .py , create a .bat file to do it for you . Code for that : [CODE] Or whatever you have for your OS . Personally I like to use [CODE] and then ui.setupUi() .

But this is not a problem , because it is just an ordinary python module , and so it 's easy enough to import it into your main application and access it from there . All you need to do is create a subclass of the top-level object from Qt Designer ( which will be a QMainWindow , QDialog or QWidget ) , and then use the setupUi method provided by the generated module to add all of the widgets to an instance of that subclass . So if the top-level object from Qt Designer was named \" MainWindow \" , pyuic will create a corresponding Ui_MainWindow class that can be imported into a main.py script and used something like this : [CODE] See Using Qt Designer in the PyQt Documentation for more details .",

Could someone try to clearly explain how I would prove this , in a way that would work for an O(n^3) algorithm as well ? It 's O(n^2) because you 've got a multiplication , not a sum .

This gives insertion sort a quadratic running time ( i.e . , O(n2)) . More info The best way to understand the complexity is trying to find the worst case example and following the algorithm 's steps . You prove big O complexity by considering how many operations are performed in the worst case . You 've done the counting part and entered the results in the right hand column of your image , so what remains to be proven is that the dominant term is [CODE] . Apart from the terms that involve the sum , your program consists of instructions that get executed [CODE] times so these are all [CODE] terms . Now for the terms with the sum .

So in this worst case we have [CODE] and then you have a term with a [CODE] which is [CODE] . This is due to following the mathematical identity : This can be proven by summing two of these series together , paying attention so that you add two terms that sum to [CODE] together , and then dividing the sum by two .

    "text": "I 'm in the process of building and designing my first Javascript OOP web application and I 'm wondering what kind of data structure / management system would be best to use . I know the interaction between Javascript and XML is good and fairly easy , but XML is n't meant to be used as a database . Is it better to form a combination of both ? Have a server-side language ( PHP ) generate XML and have it then be read by JS ? Or am I heading in the wrong direction with this ? Javascript itself does n't do queries .... it needs a helper like PHP , .net , or Java . It can traverse XML or JSON just fine like you say , but sending colossal XML documents with all possible data when only small amounts of the data is actually required will lead to massive overhead that will bring your app to its knees . It 's the definition of lack-of-scalability . My personal preference is JQuery Ajax talking to a PHP backend ( transactions via JSON ) . If I 'm dealing with the presentation of large datasets I 'll always page the information server-side and pipeline it ( load data ahead of and behind the current view to reduce transactions ) , and usually present in via jQuery DataTables . Grids are always your friend with large amounts of data . Again , personal preference , but I make heavy use of jQuery UI for layout and presentation , and I do write custom Javascript for the \" nifty \" one-off type things that come up . Again , any server language you have access to and are comfortable with will suffice , as Javascript is language agnostic . Javascript can get out of hand in a hurry . I 'd recommend that unless you have a ton of time on your hands that you focus on clean presentation via something baseline like HTML with judicious use of Javascript and CSS for progressive enhancement . Think about the user before you go crazy with motion , dynamic elements , etc . Do n't forget the old adage , \" 80% of the people only use 20% of the functionality \" Nail that 20% cleanly before going to town on flashy javascript fluff . Your users will thank you ! JSON is by far the fastest to parse , since it IS JavaScript . Application frameworks like EXT.JS are already doing this with great success .",

    "text": "The following describes what seems to be a bug in Ruby 1.8 ( and REE ) but has been fixed in 1.9 . I 'd like to know : Why calling == on String or Fixnum triggers calling == on other object at all ? Why calling == on String works differently depending on the other object class ? Now the code : [CODE] Example 1 [CODE] Nothing interesting here , move along . Example 2 [CODE] Calling == on String triggers == on other object of Exception class . Example 3 [CODE] Calling == on Fixnum triggers == on other object . Example 4 [CODE] Calling == on String triggers == on other object of Exception class . Ruby is an object-oriented language . In an object-oriented language , you send messages to objects and those objects then respond to those messages however they see fit . This means that the receiver of the message , and only the receiver(!) is in total control of what a message means . With some operators , however , there are certain expectations of symmetry : for example , [CODE] is expected to be the same as [CODE] . But in an OO language that is impossible ! Either a or b must be the receiver of the message , so in one case a gets to decide whether a and b are equal and in the other case b gets to decide . They might decide differently , and then the expectation of symmetry would be broken . So , in some classes equality is actually implemented something like this : [OUTPUT] Here 's an example : if you write your own Numeric class ( say , a Quaternion class ) , then the system builtin Fixnum class does n't know anything about Quaternions . So , when you ask the Fixnum 0 whether it is equal to the Quaternion ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) , it will responds false , even though that 's wrong . So , instead the Fixnum will first check : do I know how to compare myself to a Quaternion ? No , I do n't , but maybe a Quaternion knows how to compare itself to a Fixnum ! After all , the Quaternion class did n't exist when the Fixnum class was written , so the Fixnum class cannot know about Quaternions . But when the Quaternion class was written , maybe the author was so thoughtful to make it possible to compare Quaternions with Fixnums . That 's why Fixnum# == reverses the arguments and tries again . With String , it 's the same but somewhat more complicated . In Ruby , classes are n't types and subtyping and subclassing are different . Ruby itself does n't have a concept of type at all ! The type of an object is its protocol , i.e . the messages it understands and how it responds to them . But that concept is not recorded in Ruby ( unlike Objective-C , for example , which does have an explicit notion of protocol ) . There , however , some cases , where you want to break OO encapsulation , and know the specific type and even more : the specific representation of the type . ( Note : this violates OO , but it is sometimes necessary for performance . ) In cases , where Ruby needs an object to be of a specific class instead of just responding to a specific protocol , you would lose a lot of flexibility . You have to use , say , a String , even though you would much rather use a Rope instead . In order to give you back some flexibility , Ruby allows you to pass in something which is not exactly a String but which is equivalent to one and can be converted to one with a to_str method . So , unlike other languages , where A IS-A String is represented by A being a subclass of String , in Ruby , the relationship A IS-A String is represented by A having a to_str method . That 's what you are seeing above . If the argument to String# == is n't a String , then String# == does n't know what to do with it . But if it is \" string-like \" , i.e . it implements to_str , then maybe it does know how to compare itself to a String ? Note that equality is very hard to get right . People cannot even agree on what it means in a purely functional language , and that 's the easy case ! In Ruby , there are two additional complications : mutable state and OO . Mutable state means that two objects that were equal a moment ago may not be equal anymore a couple of moments later . Or should they be ? Or should n't they be ? And OO means that equality cannot be symmetric . That 's why the implementations of == for various core and stdlib classes are constantly improved . That 's also why you may see weird behavior now and again . Sometimes it may just be an artifact of trying to get equality right , and sometimes it might just simply be a bug . By the way : for the arithmetic operators , subclasses of Numeric actually have a more formal double-dispatch protocol using the coerce method . If a Numeric object does n't know what to do with another Numeric , it will ask that other object to coerce the two objects to a type that does know that . For example , if you try to add a Quaternion to a Fixnum , the Fixnum wo n't know what to do : [CODE] The + method of Fixnum will then call : [CODE] IOW : it will call Quaternion #coerce with the equivalent of [CODE] to which Quaternion will respond with an Array of [CODE] Then , Fixnum#+ will try again by simply calling [CODE] Which will now work because a is a Quaternion also and knows how to add two Quaternions . A very common implementation of coerce is simply to swap the arguments , i.e . [CODE] That 's equivalent to the behavior you are seeing with Fixnum# == . Again : this kind of dispatch is hard to get right , and there are improvements being made to the coerce protocol . Ruby has four levels of object equivalence : #equal ? \u2013 same object #eql ? \u2013 highest level of equivalence below same object # == \u2013 \" standard \" equality # == = , # = ~ , #hash , etc . \u2013 loose equivalence , \" same group \" equivalence Mindful programmer equips each of her classes with all of these methods except #equal ? , which should never be overriden . Going back to the subject of your question , many built-in Ruby objects have their share of idiosyncrasies in the implementation of these methods . Ruby core team constantly works to improve them , so you should make your way from 1.8 to 2.0 , which fixes a number of 1.8 problems . One more thing to mention with # == method , is that for the classes that represent elements of ordered sets , you do not implement # == directly , but instead you provide #<=> three-way comparison method, and include Comparable module, which gives you for free methods such as #==, #<, #> , #sort , etc . Yet one more thing to mention with all of these operators and operator-like methods , be mindful of the existence of #coerce method , which is currently undergoing improvements in Ruby 2.0 .",

How can i close the chain Template -> js -> urls -> view method -> Template ? Many Thanks in advance When you use server side rendering , you cannot close the \" chain \" you are refering to as easily . This is because what Django does in this case is serve all the HTML and JS ( at leas the JS inside your HTML view ) in a single initial response . The ajax requests you do after that will not be bound to the variables you send initially in your response because this variables are populated when the render() function is called . After that moment , you cannot add or update the variables that were sent to the HTML template . The only way you can manage rendering small parts of HTML is using JQuery or making your backend a REST API with Django Rest Framework and moving to a more complete frontend framework like Angular or React . The are many discussions over server side rendering vs client side rendering .

    "text": "I 've got a few questions about throwing exceptions in C++ . From what I know about them .. . An exception can be thrown from within the main() function . Any block of code that can throw an exception in the main() function should be surrounded by [CODE] and [CODE] statements as follows [CODE] In the example above , why is the argument to the catch a const char * . Does n't C++ allow for strings ? Also , is it possible to throw an exception that is n't a const char * , like an int ? or a char ? Does throwing an exception in foo , terminate the foo function ? Are there cases where you could put the try and catch statements in the same function as the throw ? Sorry if these are basic questions . Thanks SO [OUTPUT] Because you threw string literal which decays to const char* . In short , you catch what you throw . [OUTPUT] It does , but to catch string , you need to throw string in first place . [OUTPUT] You can throw literally anything . It is a good idea to throw special exception classes , like std::exception and derived from it . [OUTPUT] Yes , it does . [OUTPUT] If you want , you can do that . There are not much cases where doing it is a good idea . It looks like you need to get a good book and read chapter about exceptions . In the meantime this super-FAQ entry might help you/ You can throw an object of any type . EDIT : ( Hopefully I got this right now ) What you have done is throw a C-string , which is of type const char[13] in this case . C-Arrays will decay to pointers to their first element , in this case a pointer of type const char* . Typically what you want to do is throw a predefined exception object . They can be found in header <stdexcept> and are derived from a base class std::exception . The derived exception classes are for instance std::logic_error , std::range_error , std::bad_alloc etc . Their constructors take a string as argument , so you can for instance [CODE] This message can be accessed in a catch statement like this : [CODE] If an exception is caught , so-called stack unwinding takes place . You can then deal with the error locally , or rethrow the exception . Only when an exception is thrown and never caught , std::terminate() is called an the program aborted . You can put try/catch statements anywhere . However , remember what the term \" exception \" actually means . Cases that can easily dealt with using a simple conditional expression [CODE] [CODE] or something like that , do n't need the exception treatment . Especially if you can realistically expect this kind of unwanted condition to be true often . Then it is not something \" exceptional \" . If you decide to deal with an error using exceptions and they can not be treated locally , you may put try/catch clauses around the beginning and end of main() . Since you can put several catch statements directly after a try statement , you can then begin to deal with more specific errors , or simply catch anything via [CODE] . This is all described in great detail ( including pointers on when and when not to use it , in the C++ FAQ . EDIT : Here 's an example that makes use of try/catch statements . However , not an exception object is caught , but an int ( errno ) . Just to show , that you can really throw/catch anything you like . Let process_several_files() be a function somewhere nested in your code : [CODE]",

Reasons : This is a warning from a production system . I do n't want to change the source . The next time a warning like this occurs , I would like to see the stacktrace immediately Is there a flag or setting for python which I can change , to see not only one line , but the while stacktrace ? I need the upper frames to debug this . In this environment Python 2.7 gets used . If I want to find the root of a warning I generally just promote Warnings to Exceptions . In your case you could simply use warnings.simplefilter or warnings.filterwarnings . For example : [CODE] which gives a complete traceback : [CODE] And if you want to debug this you could easily hook Pythons pdbs on the last encountered exception : [CODE] resulting in : [CODE] This starts a post-mortem analysis of the last encountered exception . Which should enable you to dig through the frames and inspect the variables , etc . You also asked about a flag , and indeed there is a flag that enables \" warning handling \" , the [CODE] flag . It 's very much like the warnings.filterwarnings function . For convenience I just copied the documentation of the [CODE] flag here : [OUTPUT] You would need to do the following : Create if USER_SITE does not exists : issue [CODE] , see USER_SITE variable contents Place a file usercustomize.py in that directory with the following code : [CODE] Credits to this answer for the code .

Would n't it be easier to simply coerce them to dates ? [CODE] The reason your gsub does n't work is because . has a special meaning in regex . You can have it interpreted literally by specifying [CODE] . in your gsub call , \" . \" is your pattern . The \" . \" symbol in a pattern means \" any character \" , so you 're talling gsub to replace every character with a dash . The correct gsub call requires escaping the period so R knows this is a literal period : [CODE] This syntax will have gsub replace all periods with dashes . But really , this is n't what you want , you want dates . You need to use as.Date like so : [CODE] Your intended solution would only have converted your strings to a different string format . Using as.Date tells R to treat the values as dates and not strings .

    "text": "I am currently making a script which will add to cart and checkout items on e-commerce websites run on the shopify platform I 'm trying to speed up the process by running the add to cart method on multiple threads . My add to cart function looks like this : [CODE] where keywords is the list of strings so we can parse and find the correct item , and session is the a new session from the requests module . The function first parses through the sitemap , finding the unique product ID , then sends a post request to the session variable to add said item to cart . However , when I run the script using threads to add multiple items to cart , i only see one of the items in the cart . Why is n't this working ? Would I need to lock + unlock the session variable and send the POST request one by one ? Here 's the code that I am running : [CODE] From my experience , if you hit Shopify with multiple cart changes at the same time , only one will go through . My guess is that Shopify handles the cart something like this : At time 0 we have our initial cart - call it cart0 At time t , we submit n simultaneous requests to add/update/change the cart Request 0 : take cart0 and apply request , return result Request 1 : take cart0 and apply request , return result .. . Request n : take cart0 and apply request , return result This seems consistent with the cart return values that I got when I tested multiple requests at the same time - each callback function would trigger with a cart that had a single change applied . I 've found two ways to deal with this limitation . The first is to make sure the requests are chained so that we wait for one to finish before making the next - effectively turning the asynchronous requests into synchronous ones . Not the best for speed . The other method only works if we do n't have line item properties to worry about : combining all the additions/changes into one call to /cart/update.js , passing the variant IDs and desired quantities all at once - see https://help.shopify.com/themes/development/getting-started/using-ajax-api#update-cart for examples . If you do n't have line properties to worry about , changing your single-line additions into one big update will be a significant speed and reliability increase .",

    "text": "I have a javafx application with a TableView . Only the first column ( dataTypeColumn ) is editable and it contains a ComboBox for editing . Now the TableView does what it is supposed to do , however there is a combination of weird bugs when i start editing a cell and then scroll it out of view without commiting the edit . I am pretty sure it is because of the way TableView reuses the cells . However I have n't found any way to intervene with it , for example to forbid reuse of cells that are currently editing . Can you help me with that . Even though I am pretty sure it is because of cell reuse , I will write the whole problem below , in case the source of the problem is a different . The column in question contains Values of the enum DataType I have a cell Factory for that column looking like this : [CODE] The values for the column get read like this : [CODE] In case this is confusing , the items that I give my TableView are Integers ( from 0 to n-1 ) , and in the different column CellValueFactories the actual values will be loaded depending on the Integer assoziated with the current column . So when editing it , it shows a ComboBox with all the Values that DataType can have and let 's the user select one . I have a callback on the column that reacts to the Edit commited event and looks like this : [CODE] So about the problems that occur . At the beginning all cells in that column have the same value : \" nothing selected \" . It is a special value of the enum reserved for this case , as I did n't find a setPlaceholder function on the ComboBoxTableCell class . When I know start editing one of the cells and then scroll it out of view , one of the next rows will suddendly be in the editing state as well , even though that row has not been touched before . If I scroll further an cell in the editing state will appear every time the previous one scrolls out of view . I can also go back and will find the same cells in the editing state . If I edit the cell that should not be in the editing state , it will not change , but instead the cell that I originally tried to edit will change it 's value . This might be due to the underlying ObservableList , that automatically updates the value in the column . If I start editing a cell that has a different value ( from a previous edit ) , something even more weird happens . When scrolling it out of view again a new row will have a cell in the editing page , however with the default value \" nothing selected \" . If I scroll backwards the cell that i tried to edit originally will no longer be in the editing state however it 's value has changed to \" nothing selected \" . As if the new cell that got the editing state somehow commited it 's own value . Please some help with this :) This indeed seems to be a bug . Rather surprising , if you move the scroll bar with the mouse , the edit is properly canceled , but not , if you use the mouse wheel to scroll . You can easily create a workaround for this buf however , since you simply have to cancel the edit , when the item is replaced . You could e.g . use this method to create the [CODE] on your own : [CODE]",

Anyone know how to work around this ? This happens when one of the objects you 're linking into an executable changes significantly . For example it gains or loses some lines of profilable code . The minimal case to produce the error is with 2 source files . Here are 2 example source files called c .. . [CODE] and stuff.c [CODE] What they do is n't important . To build them , here is a simple Makefile : [CODE] The Makefile is set up so that the compilation is [CODE] , [CODE] and finally [CODE] . If we compile and link those C files with the [CODE] options then the executable file has profiling . Run that execuatable and you 'll get 2 output files , main.gcda and stuff.gcda . So far so good . Now change the line [CODE] to [CODE] . The Makefile should cause just stuff.c to recompile , and the executable to relink . Next time you the test executable gets run you 'll get the [OUTPUT] message for the main.gcda file . The stuff.gcda file is not affected since its object file has been recreated with all the new summary information . If you recompile main.c and relink the executable , then the error message goes away . So what can be done ? I 'd love to know ! At the moment I run [CODE] whenever I need to re-check coverage , which is not really ideal .

    "text": "I 'm reading the book Programming Entity Framework : DbContext and I just read the chapter on the three data loading types : Lazy loading ( default ) Eager loading Explicit loading Now I 'm asking myself which data loading is better in which situation . A concrete comparison would be nice ! I have n't found any . For example , I 'm using default lazy loading on a module for a client . This module deals with sales reps and imply these related tables : Reps Reps_Zones Reps_Prerequisites Users Reps_Languages etc . On the module , I use all these tables to dispatch appointments ( about 150 appointments to 50 reps at a time ) , but it 's slow . Would using a different loading strategy really improve the performances ? Lazy-loading seems most suitable for smaller apps without separate data layers . Once the app grows and you start separating it into separate layers , lazy loading becomes less useful . The DBcontext has long since been destroyed by the time the data gets to the UI layer , and while you are within the datalayer it is not a big deal to specify the properites to load . Lazy loading is turned off for validation , so if a property is marked as required and you have only loaded the parent an error will always be thrown which is very frustrating . Lazy loading also makes debugging rather tricky as the query isnt executed until it is used so you ca n't examine the results of the query as easily . I usually add a ToList() or similar to my EF queries so I can easily examine the results .",

    "text": "I have a case where I want to check if an optional I have is Equal to a string . First I have to unwrap it to check if it exists , then I want to check if it is equal to another string . However that gives me a problem where I have to write the same code twice . I 'll give you an example : [CODE] As you can see , I have to write the else statement twice . Once , if the name exists and it is not ' John ' , and another time for when the name does not exist . My question is , how can this be done the proper way . Thanks for your help ! Optional has an [CODE] operator defined for it in the Swift standard library : [CODE] That means if the optional contains a value that 's equatable , you can compare two optionals . If the two optionals are both nil they 're equal , and if the two optionals wrap values that are equal , then they 're equal . So if you do n't care about whether person.name is nil or not , just whether it contains a value of \" John \" , you can just write [CODE] . How does that work , when \" John \" is a String not a String ? ? * Because Swift will implicitly convert any type to an optional wrapping that type if that 's what an argument requires . So because the [CODE] function for comparing optionals requires a String ? argument , \" John \" will be implicitly converted to [CODE] , allowing the [CODE] operator between two optionals to be used . * well actually \" John \" is n't a String either , it 's a string literal that is getting converted into a String Since you are testing for three different conditions , correct value , incorrect value , or no value , there will be some amount of duplication . This can be minimized by extracting the duplication into a new method , such as : [CODE]",

    "text": "I created a Service Object called Transaction which processes an order made , sets up the payments and then sets up a model association . The class is called Transaction with two methods , initialize and pay . I am testing it in [CODE] ( it is in [CODE] ) . The initialize method takes in an account and some parameters passed in by the user to process the order . I am trying to test pay with rspec . How do I actually do such a test ? This function has a lot going on . For example , it creates new models , and then sets up some associations between them . So far , I created a double account as follows : [CODE] [CODE] However , there are many functions ( and associations ) used in the Transaction pay method . So for example when these associations are called ( once I call Transaction.pay in the test ) , it returns an error : [CODE] The business model is a double just like account , and added as an attribute to @account . How can I test my Transaction.pay when it creates new models and associations in there ? Do I need to mock all of them as shown above ? Or is there a better way to do it ? I am using FactoryGirl , but I am unable to use it as my account model uses Devise . Devise test helpers cannot be used outside of controllers , and since I 'm testing in services , it wo n't work . It 's hard to be specific , since you 've not provided your Transaction class code , but at a high level , here 's what I 'd recommend : Do not use FactoryGirl or Devise helpers - ideally , you 're writing a unit test for this class , so you do n't want any external dependencies . Stub out any model instances you 're dealing with - which is what you 've done with account . Stub out any external classes being used within the service ( such as Business ) , and if you 're creating instances of those from the classes , then they 're doubles too . Here 's a vague example with no real implementation : [CODE] You 'll note I 've only required the transaction file - this helps you be aware of what other classes it depends on , because you 'll ( ideally ) stub the constants , or if necessary , require other files . It 'll keep this spec 's running time much better too . Also , I only stubbed confirmed ? , not confirmed on the account double . From a Rails perspective they mean the same thing , but it 's better to use one of them consistently , instead of both . If you have a ton of setup ( a lot of constants and test doubles ) , then I 'd take that as a sign that this Transaction class probably needs to be broken up into several more specific classes .",

    "text": "There are many optimization problems that are known to be NP-hard , such as the traveling salesman problem , MAX-SAT , or finding the minimum chromatic number of a graph . Given a problem of this sort , I 'm curious about the complexity of the following problem : [OUTPUT] Intuitively , it seems like this might be co-NP hard , since it 's easy to refute an answer to an optimization problem by guessing a better solution and using it as a witness , but I have no idea how to show this . In fact , I do n't really know how to reason about the complexity of this problem . Does anyone know of any good lower bounds on the complexity of this decision problem ? Knowing whether this was co-NP hard , PSPACE-hard , etc . would be really interesting . The term ' NP-hard optimization problem ' seems a bit too broad to let a satisfying answer be found . For instance , I ca n't see what precludes decision problems from being considered NP-hard optimization problems - if you consider , say , the MAX-CNF-SAT problem with the solutions being scored as floor(k/N) , where k is the number of satisfied clauses and N is the total number of clauses in the instance ( which is clearly computable in polynomial time ) , then any valuation which yields a 1 in this formula will have to satisfy the whole formula . So let 's assume that we are maximizing floor(k/N) and call this the FLOOR-CNF-SAT optimization problem : ) This implies you can reduce TAUTOLOGY to said optimization problem - negate the input and add any solution as S . You can even add a dummy variable to make sure the initial solution is gets a 0 in the FLOOR-CNF-SAT problem . Negation is polynomial in time . Then if a solver for the proposed problem deems S to not be optimal , there must clearly be a valuation which yields a 1 according to our crafted function and thus satisfies the whole formula - in turn providing a valuation that does not satisfy the original input to TAUTOLOGY . By cheating slightly ( using an artificially crafted optimization problem ) we have established the ' is optimal ' problem as co-NP-complete , since TAUTOLOGY is easily shown to be co-NP-complete . By your own argument the ' is optimal ' decision problem is co-NP-hard , since as a witness you only need a better solution - score S , score the witness and compare . I do n't really feel great about this reduction but I ca n't easily improve on the problem class . If you require that there be instances which score arbitrarily high and not just { 0 , 1} , I could just use [CODE] . An improvement to the class could be to only consider a problem an NP-hard optimization problem if for each K there exists an instance that has at least K solutions which all score differently . I think I can still cheat my way through that : Consider a reduction that adds N dummy variables to the TAUTOLOGY input as follows : [CODE] where S is the negated input . As an initial valuation I choose [CODE] , but as a score I give a function that returns [CODE] if the first N clauses are all false , otherwise it returns the number of satisfied clauses . Such a function would only return 2N if all the clauses were satisfied but could easily have at least N distinct values . I am afraid that without some complicated regularity conditions on the scoring function this is the best we can get , unless you consider the definition of an NP-hard optimization problem to be ' a problem for which , given a candidate solution S , we can in polynomial time verify whether S is optimal ' , in which case ' is-optimal ' is clearly P and it 's no fun at all:/ Because S is a candidate solution ; given that there are no other S in which S can be proven to be greedy or less optimal than any other S . It must be that S is at current the MOST optimal solution for the problem .",

The CSS I want to process is page-specific and so I want to set a variable in my index.php to only echo the CSS when the variable is set . index.php [CODE] header.php [CODE] import.php [CODE] The header is properly set for this file . and the CSS is interpreted . styles.css.php [CODE] How can I make sure $name is set to it 's value , as set in index.php ? EDIT : My final solution was to make an object from the stdClass and add the variables I needed as attributes to the object . putting a GET request in the link to the CSS file which was the Base64 of the JSON string of the object . The problem is that you are linking to that styles.css.php from inside the rendered html . This means that page will be fetched in a separate request ( as you can se when you inspect the page ) . This request never passes trough your index.php , and so the $name variable will not be set . I would advise you to include the css in the rendered HTML inside a style block . It should be as easy as changing your import.php to this : [CODE] This also has the added benefit of reducing the number of requests the browser has to make , and should therefore speed up the page . This is btw not a very standard method of using css . I believe it would be better to add some sort of id ( or data attribute ) on your body tag that indicates the name of the page you are on . In the css file ( that does not run trough php , just a standard css file ) , you could then do something like this : [CODE] The <link> tag makes an HTTP request for a file totally independent of the PHP pages that are including each other , so $name is not available in styles.css.php .

    "text": "I need a way to be able to read from a UTF-8 encoded file and store data from it into \" UTF-8 compatible strings \" of some sort , in C++ . This data needs to be written back to a UTF-8 encoded file later on . There seems to be a lot of advice on google about doing this in Windows but I cannot find any help for Unix systems . Thanks for your help ! If all you need to do is read and write it then std::string is fine . [CODE] This works because no multi-character UTF codepoint overlaps with an an ASCII character so the standard processing of text works just fine in relation to end of line sequence and there is no other processing done by the stream . What you read is what you get . Outputting the string does not change any of the codepoints . Now if you need to manipulate the text that is a different question and gets more complex . Usually manipulating UTF-8 is way to hard ( can be done but not worth it IMO ) . When it comes to manipulating the text you want to convert the UTF-8 ( which is not a fixed width ) to an internal fixed width format ; ( UTF-16 or UTF-32 are common formats for manipulation and easy to use ; ( UTF-16 windows , UTF-32 for most * nix like OS ) ) . The easiest way to do this is to imbue the stream with a facet that knows the input is in UTF-8 and will convert it automatically . There are a couple of these facets floating around in different libraries . But an easy one to find is boost : http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_38_0/libs/serialization/doc/codecvt.html Note : It is also in the latest version of boost 1.46 [CODE] The processes is the same for writting UTF-16/32 back to a stream and converting it to UTF-8 [CODE] Note . You should imbue the file before it is opened . Different implementations of the stream will react differently if you imbue the stream after it is open . Thus it is best to imbue the stream before opening it . Dinkumware also has a set of conversion facets ( not sure if they are free ) . http://www.dinkumware.com/manuals/default.aspx?manual=compleat&page=index_cvt.html#Code%20Conversions Note : I prefer to use the terms UTF-X rather than UCS-Y . Though technically there are very minor differences these are inconsequential compared to the confusion you can create by switching between the two terms while talking about the subject .

    "text": "This code takes practically no time at all when optimizing with -O3 [CODE] What compiler optimization is making this code go from 0.014 seconds with -O0 to 0.000000 with [CODE] The internal large loop has no side effects since you 're not using B anywhere , so any decent compiler with [CODE] will eliminate it . To avoid that , you could try to summarize the values and print out the outcome at the end . Alternatively , printing some random element from B might make the compiler suspicious enough to avoid that elimination It is hard to say for sure without checking the generated assembly . In general , there is as-if rule , which [OUTPUT] It could be , for instance , that since neither A no B are used anywhere , the compiler just omits [CODE] as well as [CODE]",

    "text": "I have a problem . I spend around 5 hours trying everything , but I was not even able to reproduce it properly so I include the simplified original source code . I apologize for the extent , but I wanted to include all the relevant information I found out so far . This is one of the few times I feel completely powerless and kindly request your help . Any ideas are welcome . Also any comments that can bring at least some light to the matter . The behaviour in this case is a complete mystery to me . I am programming in QtCreator in Ubuntu . I am trying to develop a framework to solve mathematical problems using a Population of candidate solutions , which should evolve into the true solution . There are 3 classes involved : Population , PopulationMember and Problem : [CODE] Usually my program runs in loops , where the population calls its various methods . One of them is Population::evaluate() . My program ran great until I introduced some new methods of Population . [CODE] Then I get a segmentation error in the middle of program . The strangest thing is that it happens only after the 10 loops , after the population executed report() . Also after some experimentation , when I excluded all the operations which require dynamic allocation of some sort ( strings ) from the report() method , I do not get the error . Conversely when I disable the sorting method ( uses either std::sort or qSort ) the problem stops . Also when I leave the actions done by the temp Population , there is no problem . So I started to debug the program . I let it complete 10 loops and started to debug step by step . I went into [CODE] [CODE] [CODE] debug : The addres printed out is 0xbffff628 . This is same as the previous [CODE] printouts . I go inside the [CODE] [CODE] Here I switch to assembly code : [CODE] I go inside the call of function at the last instruction . At the instant I do this , all the attributes in problem_ become not accessible according to my debugger . At this point all is lost . [CODE] debug : Finally the address the problem_ is pointing at becomes 0xbffff780 instead of 0xbffff628 . An increment of 344 This happens always . The increment is 344 . If I make some minor changes in the program , the address changes , but the difference between these two addresses remains 344 . This is all the more puzzling , since the size of all my three classes is less than 100 . The program crashes inside the [CODE] method as soon as some logic is involved . EDIT : [CODE] [CODE] You are copying around Population-instances quite a bit : 1 . you are returning a local copy by value , 2 . copying again by assigning into another local with [CODE] All these instances get pointers to PopulationMember and ownsMembers_ is always set true - this looks quite a bit fishy and you might want to debug with breakpoints in your destructors/constructors to find out the lifecycle of each population and its members . EDIT : append method [CODE] This means that the members to not point to the correct Population anymore ! The value of Population& is stored on stack and gets deleted after the [CODE] loop ends , but the PopulationMembers still point to these Populations . Edit : Fix please try this : [CODE]",
