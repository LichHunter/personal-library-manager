Is this the correct/best practice approach in context of using this app on glassfish ? or should find another method of doing this ? It 's discouraged to create your own threads because the app server is meant to be in charge . See the answers to Why is spawning threads in Java EE container discouraged ? However in practice , especially if it 's the only application on there , you might be OK , especially if you use a fixed thread pool . Be sure all the threads are gone when you undeploy the app .

Then derive all my other view controllers in the app from this one . Which of these two options is better ? Or is there a better way to do this than these two options ?

This creates a good separation of code and makes it clear where the database methods are located both when looking at a view controller .

    "text": "I like Google Web Tookit API approach . It use Java language behind the scenes that compiles ONLY JavaScript code WHOSE TARGET BROWSER NEEDS . It happens some developers would like to use that feature in pure JavaScript language . Anwser : WHAT COULD WE SUGGEST in order to fullfill this requirement ? I suggest to use JavaScript comments ( as a flag ) as a way some compiler ( like Yahoo JavaScript compiler ) analises our app JavaScript code and generates only a JavaScript Framework code needed . Example : a hypothetical JavaScript framework ( JQuery , Mootools , Prototype ect ) code [CODE] So when my app use a function sayHello , only that sayHello function and its dependencies would be filtered through JavaScript comments , nothing else . So , this way our application would be lighter , by using only JavaScript Framework code needed . And you : what do you suggest ? I would suggest learning to program in JavaScript and understanding the various peculiarities of the different DOM implementations , then writing just the code necessary for your application . If you really do n't want to have to deal with re-creating all the event handling shenanigans and so on , then nick the relevant techniques from the libraries . You 'll learn a lot more about what you 're doing that way , as you 'll need to actually understand how it all works to be able to integrate those techniques with your application . Having worked professionally with JavaScript since 1996 I , like many , was initially tempted by the apparent ease of use offered by libraries ; but if I see one more answer on here that says \" use jQuery \" ( followed by some code that is n't even optimal in jQuery ) when the correct answer is to use an existing and well-documented feature of JavaScript that works on every single implementation since Netscape Navigator 3 , I 'll scream ;-) I do n't know about other frameworks , but with Dojo Toolkit you can take advantage of caching better by using a public CDN copy of the source in your site , from AOL or Google . If the JavaScript code of the framework is served as a cacheable file then the download cost of requesting the entire framework ( e.g . jQuery.js ) can be eliminated , but if you were generating the framework code on the fly ( as you suggest above ) then it 's going to be harder to take advantage of caching . On top of this the memory cost of defining the entire framework is probably unlikely to be problematic ( assuming the framework is written sensibly ) . So , pulling in the entire framework , as is the common case , is simple , works well and does n't require a particular server-side infrastructure ( like GWT does ) .",

    "text": "I have a server-client application [ TCP sockets , .NET 4.0 ] . . the application about : do the commands that received from the client receives files send a screenshot image the application should do the 3 tasks in the same time After i done that and it worked . . i realized that these kind of application should use one port for all tasks . . like Radmin and netsupport . . etc but i used 3 ports . . one to keep receiving commands any time the client sends . and one for receiving files . . and one if the client asked for a screenshot so is it fine to use 3 ports for a network application ? . . I 've tried to create 3 sockets on the client side to connect to server on the same port ( ex:9090 ) but when i tried to send a file from the client . . the server received the bytes in Job function that 's should receives the commands only .. . so it looks like i ca n't use one port for those tasks so is it possible use one port for all of the three tasks that they may work at the same time ? [CODE] Added question : lets say the server has one port . the client connect to server for commands . . let 's call it cmdClient which its port is 11589then a Job Thread started for this client like the code up . then the client connect with another socket to the server . . dataClient which its port is 1800 then when i use the dataClient to send a file . . the server receives the bytes at the job Method . . ! ! why does that happene ? Yes , it is wise to use multiple ports when doing file transfers . It would require a quite advanced protocol to use the same port and still keep the application response ( as you still have to be able to send commands during file transfers ) . But I do not recommend you to use three fixed ports . Use one port for all commands and an arbitrary number of ports for the file transfers . A file transfer would look like this : ( CmdPort ) Client -> Server Hey I want to transfer file XXX with size YYYY ( CmdPort ) Server -> Client Roger , connect to port 8217 and transfer the file ( 8217 ) Client -> Server Connects , transfer the entire file , disconnect ( 8217 ) Server Checks that the transferred size matches the one specified in step #1 That allows you to transfer several files at the same time . Let the server create a new listening socket using port 0 . It tells the OS to select a free port . Then use Socket.LocalEndpoint to find out the port before sending it back in step #2 . The specified approach also lets you take advantage of Socket.SendFile which is probably the most effective and fastest way to send files using .NET . ( FTP uses the same approach , as do bittorrent . You might have used a file manager when downloading files from the web . They takes a more extreme approach and splits up the file download over multiple sockets to get around web server bandwidth throttling . ) update in response to a comment : [OUTPUT] You did not specify that information in the original question , which made me assume that you only transfer one file at a time . Batch transfers would work in the same way , just change so that step #1 sends a list of filename+size and then send all files after each other in step #3 . It would not be best practice to use 3 ports unless each operation was it 's own application , i.e . a file server , an image server etc . You should create one application listening on 1 port and then use Threading to accept multiple connections to the server ( each with it 's own instance of a StreamReader ) . You could then write a parser method for the users input . For example , if the user sends the command \" RECIEVE FILE \" , the server would expect a File , if the user sent the command \" IMAGE \" the server would expect an image .

As always ... I ' ll keep researching while awaiting an answer . Found this about an hour after posting this question . Maybe two . Apparently report_times is part of debugging symbols (?) for GCC . To exclude report_times ( which causes the ' failed to get process times ' from the original question ) you have to build the debug ... or release ... version of gcc . To do this , I used info from this link : http://www-gpsg.mit.edu/~simon/gcc_g77_install/build.html BUT , I omitted the [CODE] from the [CODE] and [CODE] and I added [CODE] without [CODE] just in case .

A big part of Valgrind 's magic is how it is able to intercept/redirect function calls in order to keep track of the state of the world . As I understand it , redirection is achieved using shared object/function name patterns which when matched ' redirect ' calls to new addresses . Checking out the valgrind source , we find the notion of a ' redirector ' : [CODE] ( m_redir.c line 10 4) So ' Specs ' provide shared object/function name to address mappings and ' Actives ' represent the mappings themselves . Active computation : [CODE] ( m_redir.c line 120 ) The idea of \" conflicting redirections \" is mentioned here too : [CODE] ( m_redir.c line 15 2) And for interests sake , here is where your warning is generated : [CODE] ( m_redir.c line 66 4) So , after all this it is probably safe to assume that : The redirection messages are part of normal valgrind operation .

There is no way to find out where that data is stored . You could fake your own WM_DRAWITEM message , albeit that it is very hard to do since you must inject code to create the HDC , but that just gets you pixels , not bytes .

Once you 've got SBT installed you can search Maven Central for \" commons-math \" , which will take you here . You 'll see a \" Scala SBT \" button on the side ; click it and copy the text to a file called build.sbt : [CODE] Okay , now you can start an SBT console with [CODE] .

When I copy a BitArray to byte[] , the internal ordering of the BitArray leads to incorrect output . For instance , with an input of [CODE] , ToString() should return 255.255.255.0 ( this works because the bits are symmetrical ) . However , an input of 30 results in 255.255.255.63 instead of the expected 255.255.255.252 .

    "text": "I have a web application in which we use JSF framework . I have been diving deep into the security part for web application and hence I was looking to generate my own unique session ID ( using encryption algorithm and assign it to every new session which gets created once user logs in . Can anyone please guide me on how to set manual generated session id in session and ensure with each request that session id is transmitted . Thanks . Attempting to do this at the JSF application layer is unlikely to be successful ; I would perform this task at a lower level API . I am assuming a servlet container . I can think of two approaches : do this at a container level via a server-specific SPI ( if one even exists ) do this by rewriting requests/responses via a servlet Filter There is insufficient information to comment on the viability of the first approach . In the second , you would have to determine the name of the session cookie ( it is usually JSESSIONID , but does not have to be ) . Your API would : map the filter to all application requests maintain a map of container session ids to \" secure \" ids use the filter to rewrite any session cookie in the request with the session id use the filter rewrite any session cookie in the response with the secure id use a listener to remove invalid sessions from the map to avoid memory leaks I really doubt you 'll generate session IDs that are more secure than the ones generated by the container , but here 's what you could do , without using any container-specific extension . Create a servlet filter which intercept every request to the server . When a request comes in , check if a session already exists for this request ( using getSession(false)) . If one exists , then extract your specific cookie MY_SESSION_ID from the request , and compare its value to the one that is stored in the session . If they do n't match , reject the request . If the session does n't exist , then create it ( using getSession(true)) , generate your super-secure session ID , store it as a session attribute and add the cookie MY_SESSION_ID to the response . This has the disadvantage of creating a session automatically , even if it 's not strictly needed . But that 's the case most of the time when using JSPs of component frameworks .",

    "text": "I 'm working on an automatic summarization system in my C++ class and have a question regarding one of the ASCII comparisons I 'm doing . Here 's the code : [CODE] What is being done here ( with the two if statements ) is checking whether a new sentence has begun in the text that is to be analyzed and dealt with later . The conditionals work but only because we discovered that we have to check for that -1 as well . Any ideas what that represents ? As an ASCII character -1 does n't represent anything ( which is to say -1 is not a valid ASCII value ) . As the return value from get() it means that the read operation failed - most likely due to the end of file being reached . Note that the eof() function does n't return true if the next call to get will fail because of the end of file being reached - it returns true if the previous call to get failed because of the end of file being reached . The fact that checking for -1 works is an accident , and has nothing to do with ASCII values ( which only use 0 to 127 ) . Your code will fail if either plain char is unsigned ( compile with /J with VC++ , I think ) , or EOF is n't -1 ( rare , but all that 's guaranteed is that it is negative ) . You 're code will also fail if the input happens to be Latin-1 , and it contains a ' \u00ff ' . The basic problem in your code is that you 're not checking for end of file correctly . Putting the test at the top of the loop does n't work ; you need to test for failure ( not eof()) after input , before using the value read . There are several ways of doing this ; in your case , the simplest is probably to use : [CODE] Alternatively , you can make ch an int , and do : [CODE] This has the advantage that the following call to tolower is no longer undefined behavior ( tolower takes an int , which must be in the range [CODE] EOF \u2014 if plain char is signed , you are n't guaranteeing this ) . On the other hand , it does n't allow chaining , i.e . you ca n't write the equivalent of : [CODE] ( which could be useful in some cases ) . FWIW : the technique you 're using is something called a sliding window into a stream , and it 's worth pushing it off into a separate class to handle the logic of keeping the window filled and up to date . Alternatively , a simple state machine could be used for your problem . And I 'd definitely avoid using magic constants : if you want to check for a carriage return , compare with ' \\r ' . Similarly , newline is ' \\n ' , and in the outer [CODE] , it looks like you want to check for whitespace ( [CODE] [CODE] [CODE] ) , rather than comparing for the values . I might also add that your code fails to correctly handle sentences that end with a quote , like This is the \" text in your input . \" ; it also fails for abbreviations like Mr . Jones is here. . But those problems may be beyond the scope of your assignment . ( The abbreviations one is probably not fully solvable : sometimes \" etc . \" is the end of a sentence , and sometimes it 's not . )",

In reply to \" Now what do I need to do to make it runnable by double clicking the jar file , instead of running it from command line ? \" ( Tried to reply in a comment but the size limit was too small . ) In Eclipse , once you have a \" run configuration \" with which the project is running correctly : Right click the project -> Export .. . -> ( from Java ) -> Runnable JAR file Next Select from the drop-down list the run configuration that launches your project .

    "text": "I 'm looking for some way to effectively hide inherited members . I have a library of classes which inherit from common base classes . Some of the more recent descendant classes inherit dependency properties which have become vestigial and can be a little confusing when using IntelliSense or using the classes in a visual designer . These classes are all controls that are written to be compiled for either WPF or Silverlight 2.0 . I know about ICustomTypeDescriptor and ICustomPropertyProvider , but I 'm pretty certain those ca n't be used in Silverlight . It 's not as much a functional issue as a usability issue . What should I do ? Update Some of the properties that I would really like to hide come from ancestors that are not my own and because of a specific tool I 'm designing for , I ca n't do member hiding with the [CODE] operator . ( I know , it 's ridiculous ) I think you 're best least hackish way is to consider composition as opposed to inheritance . Or , you could create an interface that has the members you want , have your derived class implement that interface , and program against the interface . I know there 's been several answers to this , and it 's quite old now , but the simplest method to do this is just declare them as [CODE] . Consider an example I am currently working on , where I have an API that makes available every method in a 3rd party DLL . I have to take their methods , but I want to use a .Net property , instead of a \" getThisValue \" and \" setThisValue \" method . So , I build a second class , inherit the first , make a property that uses the get and set methods , and then override the original get and set methods as private . They 're still available to anyone wanting to build something different on them , but if they just want to use the engine I 'm building , then they 'll be able to use properties instead of methods . Using the double class method gets rid of any restrictions on being unable to use the [CODE] declaration to hide the members . You simply ca n't use [CODE] if the members are marked as [CODE] . [CODE] Now valueEnum is available to both classes , but only the property is visible in the APIUsageClass class . The APIClass class is still available for people who want to extend the original API or use it in a different way , and the APIUsageClass is available for those who want something more simple . Ultimately , what I 'll be doing is making the APIClass internal , and only expose my inherited class .",

    "text": "I am trying to create a table with the following : [CODE] It fails due to column length not being large enough . It would help if the SQL statement was syntactically valid and if you provided the exact error message . When reformatted and syntax corrected , the statement looks like : [CODE] And , when that is run on a system with 2KB pages , the error message is : [CODE] The standard way of getting a brief explanation of an error message is [CODE] ; it says : [CODE] The ' a total of 120 bytes ' should be ' a total of at least 120 bytes ' ; that lower-bound applies to Informix SE . In IDS ( Informix Dynamic Server ) , the lower-bound is 255 bytes , but it is bigger in more recent systems , and also bigger when the page size is bigger . You have a variety of options . You can consider why your names need to be 255 characters each - is that sensible ( would , say , 64 be sufficient ) ? If your server version is recent enough ( 10.00 or later , I believe ) , you could create the table in a dbspace with a larger page size . Since the key is a maximum of 3*255+(20/2+1) = 776 bytes , and the rule of thumb is you need to be able to store 5 maximum-length key values + ROWID/FRAGID overhead ( 8 bytes ) per page , you would need a 4 KB page size . ( Had you been running on AIX , you probably would n't have noticed the issue . ) Also , you should not be storing date values in VARCHAR(255) ; you should use DATE or perhaps DATETIME YEAR TO DAY ( a weird way of spelling DATE - though the underlying format is different , using 5 bytes on disk instead of 4 for a plain DATE ) , or perhaps DATETIME YEAR TO SECOND ( a funny way of spelling TIMESTAMP ) , or .. . The ' num0 , num1 , num2 ' fields are also dubious , too ; if they are meant to store numbers , use NUMERIC or DECIMAL - - DECIMAL(20) in most IDS databases means a 20-digit floating point decimal number . Edited to add : And , to answer the direct question , VARCHAR columns can only be up to 255 bytes long ; LVARCHAR columns can be up to about 32 KB ; CHAR columns can be up to 32 KB ; TEXT columns can be up to 2 GB , and CLOB columns can be even larger . The total length of a row is limited to about 32 KB ( but BYTE , TEXT , BLOB and CLOB columns count as a fixed size descriptor towards that 32 KB total - the actual data is stored outside the row ) . There are some version dependencies that I 'm not bringing out - if you are using IDS 10.00 or later , this is accurate .",

As for forcing your app directly to choose one of your locale 's , it is not doable afaik .

Once upon a time there was a MSWinsock.Winsock.1 COM object installed on Windows machines that could be used in a script , but no more . PortQry and PsPing are a wonderful tools but you still have to download them ( despite it being provided by Microsoft ) . So the easiest way is to rely on PowerShell . Here is the code for a simple .bat script , internally using Powershell to get the job done : [CODE] Some machines have .NET framework without PowerShell installed so in this case C# code can be embedded into a batch script using msbuild : [CODE] As for the machines without .NET framework I do n't know any native method to check remote ports . If you only want to check TCP ports you can use [CODE] . If offers a [CODE] parameter to define the TCP port .",

    "text": "I 'm trying to create a custom class that creates a button . I 'm having trouble adding a target to that button inside it 's class . This is my code [CODE] The problem is that I ca n't connect an action on button click . This works if it 's used outside my class but not inside . Usage of the class [CODE] Nothing is holding a strong reference to your SelectButton instance , so as soon as the function that creates test exits , that instance is released . The button itself is retained because you have added it as a subview . Therefore , it is still visible but there is no longer an object to respond to the action . You either need to use an instance property rather than a local variable for test , or , preferably have SelectButton inherit directly from UIButton When someone taps the button , usually you want something to happen somewhere else in your app ( like in one of your view controllers or in some other UI element ) . The way the IBAction is set up right now , you have it so that something will trigger or happen within the button itself when someone taps on it . If you want to handle a button tap programmatically instead of ctrl dragging from the button into the view controller , you can do it this way if you prefer . First , add this code into the view controller : [CODE] Then you can either add the selector programmatically by adding this method into your view controller : [CODE] Or by going to the connections inspector and dragging from the touch up inside over to the IBAction dot in your view controller code . Also , as someone else pointed out in the comments you should make your button inherit from UIButton by adding this to your class declaration : [CODE]",

Now , how to install GRUB on Master Boot Record ( MBR ) of my SSD to boot both OS . First live boot to your Linux Mint system , using external Live CD/USB Drive , then follow these commands to re-install GRUB on MBR . mount your Linux installed partition to some mount point . here XY is the number of your Linux distro partition . [CODE] Now bind some essential live root partition directories to mounted root partition at /mnt . [CODE] Now , change the root to newly mounted partition directory .

[CODE] And at last unmount all the binded partition directories , and then reboot . [CODE] That 's it , hope this will help ! ! Windows will overwrite the boot sector whenever you install it .

So the flow I would like to obtain is similar to this one : the user logs in its session is created the user works with my web application the user logs out / closes his browser ---> the session expires he is not on the platform anymore so I can perform some operations on the db about what he has done I coul n't find any method to override when the session expires .

I want only the sync process to work in background.The total sync process is taking 3 Minutes time to complete . currently i am showing a popup with message Sync is in progress which forces the user to wait for completion . Now i want the sync process to work in background without disturbing the user . i used https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-background-mode but this is working when my whole application is going in background . If there is a way to solve my problem using this plugin please post here . Thanks in advance",

    "text": "Good morning to all , What is the preferred way to embed images ( and other media in general ) in a cocoa application ? Windows executables have a resource section that allows you to store arbitrary data and extract it at runtime . Is there a similar mechanism on Mac OS X ? My program uses several icons and images ( statusmenu icon , GUI button images etc ) and I would prefer to store them inside the application or a resource library rather than just distribute them as plain files . Thank you very much ! Adding them to the resource directory is the way to go in the vast majority of cases .. . this is the default behavior . It 's good because you can postpone creation and because the system makes immutable , cached , reusable instances for you . If you do n't like that , you can just make a quick tool to generate a data representation and emit that to a C file which is compiled into your program , then use that as an input to an image creator call ( assuming you want an NSImage or CGImage representation of that ) . But that 's a bit extreme - perhaps you would favor removing the file extension ( or just changing it to something atypical ) and then copying it to the resources directory ?",

    "text": "Within a request on an ApiController , I 'm tracking the duration of awaiting the Sql Connection to open . [CODE] If my request is not called for at least 5 minutes , then any new call will see the duration of OpenAsync be huge ( c . 3s ) instead of immediate . I 'd like to understand the reason to eradicate that crazy slowness . UPDATE I created an endpoint just to open the SqlConnection . If I wait more than 5 minutes then call that OpenConnection endpoint then call any another request , the OpenConnection will incur the waiting cost mentioned above but the request will not . Hence , I 've scheduled a job on Azure to run every minute and call the OpenConnection endpoint . However , when I make requests from my http client , I incur the waiting time . As if opened the SqlConnection was somehow linked to the http client ip. . Also , that 5 minutes windows is typical of DNS TTL. . However 3s for a DNS lookup of the Database endpoint is too long . It ca n't be that . UPDATE 2 Time observed at the htt client level seems to be the result of both awaiting for the connection as well as some other latencies ( dns lookup ? ) . Here is a table summarizing what I observe : UPDATE 3 The difference between row 3 and 4 of my table is time spent in TCP/IP Connect and HTTPS Handshake according to Fiddler . Let 's not focus on it on that post but only on the time spent waiting for the SqlConnection to open . UPDATE 4 Actually I think both two waiting times have the same reason . The server needs to \" keep alive \" its connection to the database and the client needs to \" keep alive \" its connection to the server . UPDATE 5 I had a job running every 4 minutes to open the SqlConnection but once in a while it was incurring the waiting cost . So I think the inactivity time is 4 minutes not 5 ( hence I updated this post title ) . So I updated my scheduled job to run every minute . then I realised it was still incurring the waiting cost but regularly every 30 minutes ( hence I updated this post title ) . These two times strangely correlates with those of Azure Load Balancer Idle Timeout .",

    "text": "I 'm on Ubuntu 14.04 with cuda toolkit 6.5 , nvidia driver version 340.29 . My application registers a pixel buffer from openGL and writes an image to the buffer every loop , copies the PBO to a texture using glTexSubImage2D , and draws the texture . This all works properly until I change my image-generation kernel , then I gdb reports a segmentation fault in cudaGraphicsGLRegisterBuffer . My guess is this is a bug , because the cuda kernel is completely unrelated to cudaGraphicsGLRegisterBuffer , which is called before any processing . Makefile [CODE] main.cu [CODE] GLdisplay.cu [CODE] GLdisplay.h [CODE] vert.glsl [CODE] frag.glsl [CODE] Updating to nvidia display driver 346.47 solved my problem completely . For the unsure , run [CODE] in a terminal window , and if you do n't see NVIDIA-SMI 346.xx ( xx being an arbitrary number ) , update with the newest driver available from nvidia . At the time of writing this , CUDA toolkit 6.5 ships with an outdated graphics driver . Your code lacks error condition checking . First and foremost I suggest you check the error code status after each and every OpenGL and CUDA call . I 've got a very strong hunch what the problem is and adding the error checking will tell if this is the case . So : I see that you never properly unbind the PBO from OpenGL before trying to map it to a CUDA pointer . Depending on the path your program takes this may result in the PBO actually not getting mapped , hence giving you an invalid pointer that if accessed , from the CUDA kernel or the host , will result in a segfault . To pin down the problem check the error status of every OpenGL and CUDA operation . CUDA will tell you if it ca n't map a OpenGL resource , for whatever reason ( like the resource still being bound to a OpenGL functional unit ) .",

I 've tried conducting the searches with something like [CODE] but that causes Postgres to decide not to use the index at all . [CODE] Is this what you are looking for ? What do you mean by \" enforce uniqueness in a case insensitive way \" ? Or this if you want to stick to the \"lower()\" : [CODE] Use a functional index : [CODE] If you 're on 8.4 and can install a contrib module , then also take a look at the citext type . It abstracts away all the lower/UPPER stuff and is slightly better performing .",

    "text": "I am tring to do occlusion with Google Tango in Unity . What I want is pretty simple to understand : when there is a real object in front of a virtual object , the virtual object is hidden ( or rendered differently ) The perfect result would be like it is in this impressive video I found : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpDhaM7ZhZs . I already tried the \" Enable occlusion \" option of the Tango Camera and I am not so happy with the results ( it is not accurate and not real time as it is based on mesh reconstruction from the point cloud ) . If you have hints , tips or ideas about how to achieve this ( like in the video ) , that would be awesome ! Occlusion is still a very experimental feature on Tango . The problem is that it 's very hard to do occlusion with high fidelity and high performance , here 's couple of ideas on how to achieve it using different method : Use 3D reconstruction . Tango does provide functionalities to construct 3D meshes from point cloud , you can find sample code from Tango sample code repository ( C , Java , Unity ) . If you have a world that is pre-scanned , you can essentially use that mesh data to occluded virtual object . Run time up-sampling depth image . You can also project all point clouds on to an image plane , up-sample it , and use the image as a depth buffer for rendering . This is what ARScreen occlusion is using in TangoUnitySDK . Due to the limitation of Tango depth sensing hardware , the result quality is not very ideal , and it will not work if all physical objects are far away ( beyond 4 meters ) from the device .",

    "text": "Situation : I 'm building a website on Bootstrap 3.0 , and it contains a section with upcoming events . If a user wants to attend , they can do that by clicking on the event . Now a modal appears with name , e-mail and event title input fields . The e-mail goes to me so I know who 's coming for what . This is the html for a single event : [CODE] Question : How can I code this , so it automatically adds the title of an event to the e-mail by clicking on the event ? I do n't want users to type the event title manually when the modal appears . I 'm also open for better ways to do this . current process : visitor clicks on event > fills in name , e-mail and event title > submits form future process : visitor clicks on event > fills in name , email > submits form Info : I 'll be using Wordpress as CMS . I 'm assuming you are working with a custom post type for your events . Yes , you will need to populate the hidden field yourself . On the single template , in the form markup , you can output the title of the event as the value of the hidden field by using the wordpress function the_title() . You could also do it with javascript , but this is exactly the kind of situation wordpress templates and PHP are made for . You might also think about grabbing the event post id for the event using the_ID() . Two events can easily have the same title , but will never have the same post id . [CODE] It is worth noting that even though named \" hidden field \" , the values are easily accessible to anyone using your form , and after the page loads and your PHP is output , they can be changed to anything very easily and then submitted . So if you have any restrictions on what events are shown to what users , someone can potentially just replace the title in their form with an event they should n't be able to rsvp for , but you 'd never know that from the email you receive .

    "text": "Consider I have : [CODE] While the following holds : [CODE] I am facing : [CODE] Why ? I mean , it 's clear that making a Set out of a Seq chooses random elements in case of duplicates , but there are no duplicates because of [CODE] . I certainly need a deeper understanding of the kind of equality check. . EDIT : After a long search , I found the problem and condensed it to the following : My elements are not the same , however I must take a closer look why distinct.sameElements is n't complaining . But meanwhile a new question arose : Consider this : [CODE] So my elements in my first to sequences are n't the same because they depend on a m2-construct and so each time a accessing them they are different . My new question is , why does m2 behave like a function in contrast to m1 although both are immutable maps . That is n't intuitively for me . The most common reasons for problems in this area--testing set equality and the like--are hashCode does not agree with equals Your values are not stable ( so previous hashCode does not agree with current equals ) The reason is that this matters is that distinct and toSet use hash codes to build sets , whereas [CODE] simply runs over the collection with an [CODE] : [CODE] This is made more complicated by the fact that many sets do n't start using hash codes until they 're larger than some minimal size ( usually 4) , so you do n't always notice this with testing . But let 's prove it to ourselves : [CODE] Okay , so now we know that for most of these operations , matching up hashCode and equals is a Good Thing . Warning : in Java , mismatches happens frequently even with primitives : [CODE] but Scala now at least catches that ( hopefully every time ) : [CODE] Case classes also do this properly , so we 're left with three possibilities You overrode equals but not hashCode to match Your values are not stable There is a bug and Java wrapped primitive hashCode mismatch is coming back to bite you The first one is easy enough . The second one seems to be your problem , and it arises from the fact that mapValues actually creates a view of the original collection , not a new collection . ( filterKeys does this also . ) Personally , I think this is a questionable choice of design , since normally when you have a view and you want to make a single concrete instance of it , you [CODE] it . But default maps do n't have a [CODE] because they do n't realize that they might be views . So you have to resort to things like [CODE] This is really important if you 're doing things like file IO to map your values ( e.g . if your values are filenames and you 're mapping to their contents ) and you do n't want to read the file over and over again . But your case--where you 're assigning random values--is another where it is important to pick a single copy , not recreate the values over and over .",

You can solve this by setting [CODE] EDIT 1 : I start the OSGi framework ( Apache Felix ) this way : [CODE] But I guess you can directly put this setting in the \" felix.config.properties \" file .

    "text": "I have had a few items come up recently where I have a need to execute a method immediately after initial screen load . For example a couple scenario's : 1) Processing screen where the data shown in the processing screen comes from an external API ( dynamically loaded and parsed , then displayed for processing ) 2) Automatically load a second window/tab when the screen finishes loading based on data in the record . 3) A popup prompt after screen load notifying the user of a situation on the item the loaded . All three of these present different challenges which lead me to wonder if what the best day to handle these would be . For example , item 1 - currently I have an a call in the \" GetRecords \" override that if the View contains no records , calls the a long running process to go grab the records . While this works , I 'm presented with two issues If I let the long process run and then request a refresh , the user has the ability to click \" Process/Process All \" before data is available . This also effects scheduling of the process . If I block the process with a WaitTillCompleted , the user is presented with a standard page loading spinner instead of the \" Long running Process \" indicator but allows scheduling to work correctly . For #2 /3 , the request for the new window/tab and the popup both seem to be initiated from a postback to function correctly . That leads me to believe I need a javascript method to run after the page finishes init to execute the appropriate actions . Is there a better way to handle either of these situations with native framework methods ? While this does n't directly answer the need to call a method in page load , here are some options for checking for running process to control buttons or displaying messages outside of a popup .. . We have some areas where we want to wait or prevent users from re-processing before the last process completes and have implemented some of the following examples . Check to see if the process is currently running . Could be used to disable buttons or exist action buttons .. . [CODE] Wait for the currently running process to finish .. .

    "text": "I have seen this method in android source code . [CODE] why not something like this [CODE] what is the advantage of modifying argument instead of returning new value The advantage of modifying an argument instead of returning a new instance is that you put control of instantiation in the hands of the calling code - i.e . you allow it to re-use an existing instance . The ' modifying argument ' approach allows you to initialise an object using several such methods . e.g . [CODE] Arguably you could do the same thing by returning the same instance as was passed in as a parameter , but I personally think that 's asking for trouble . Another possible reason might be if the cost of instantiation was high , you might want to recycle an old object . This does n't appear to be the case with the code you present though , and it 's an optimisation so only think about doing this if absolutely necessary ! Personally I would tend to take the ' return a new instance ' approach unless there 's a specific reason not to .

My application processes incoming events from the server side which are passed to the AngularJS framework on the client side using ASP.NET SignalR . There are millions of events that can be received by my application and there is no performance issue on the server side and it easily passes these number of events one after the other to the AngularJS framework . The problem lies on the client side . After processing the event , i use $scope.$apply() to update the page and display the events .

    "text": "I have tested [CODE] loop below and do n't understand the result . [CODE] How is it possible to have the result [CODE] for the used while condition where [CODE] ? How to explain this result ? Update : and one more . Why the results are different for Double and Float ? [CODE] Update 2 and another one . Why there is no difference for [CODE] and [CODE] conditions . Does it mean that usage of [CODE] has no sense for floating point ? [CODE] What else would you expect ? The loop is executed 15 times . On the 14th time , x is 1.4 and so you add another 0.1 , making it 1.5 . If you expect the loop to terminate at 1.4 , you should increment x before checking the while condition , not after that . If you expect the loop to terminate on 1.41 , your increment is wrong and you should do [CODE] instead , making it 141 iterations . As for the second question , I am aware that Float should not be used for monetary calculations and such due to its lack of precision . However , I trusted Double so far , and the while loop in run 15 actually claims the Double value to be less than 1.0 while it is reported to be 1.0 . We have got a precision problem here , as we can see if we substract x from 1.0 : [CODE] which returns : 1.11022302462516e-16 At the same time , Float seems to be unprecise in the other direction . In the last run , it is a little bigger than 0.9 ( 0.9 + 5.96046e-08 ) , making it bigger than 10 in the following run . The reason why Double and Float are wrong in different directions is just a matter of how the values are stored , and the result will be different depending on the number . For example , with 2.0 both actual values are bigger : Double by 4.440892.e-16 and Float by 2.38419e-07 . For 3.0 Double is bigger by 1.33226e-15 and Float smaller by 7.1525e-07 . The same problems occur using x.isLess(than:1.0) , but this method is the basis for the [CODE] operator as of https://developer.apple.com/reference/swift/floatingpoint/1849403-isless isLessThanOrEqualTo(1.0) , on the other hand , seems to work reliably as expected . This answer is pretty much a question itself by now , so I 'm curious if anyone has an in-depth explanation of this .. . Update The more I think about it , the less of a Swift problem it is . Basically , you have that problem in all floating point calculations , because they are never precise . Both Float and Double are not precise , Double is just twice as accurate . However , this means that comparisons like [CODE] are useless with floating point values unless they are both rounded . Therefore , good advice in loops like those of yours with a known precision ( in your case one decimal ) would be to round to that precision before doing any kind of comparison . For example , this would fix the loop : [CODE]",

    "text": "Can the Google Chrome dev tools be used to directly change the files on the server for example by directly interacting with an ftp server ? It would make PHP editing much easier . Unfortunately editing DOM elements does n't update PHP or HTML mapped local files . This is currently a limitation of the workspace feature . CSS Styles only . As for server mapping , it should be possible but Chrome seems to be crashing when I try adding a mapped FTP location . I have n't had a chance to test any other computers of versions of Chrome/Windows Currently using Chrome 43.0.2357.130 on Windows 10 Insider Preview 10130 The DevTools can update any files that are editable via Sources , including PHP and HTML . CSS is only updated directly via the elements panel . Other text file types can be updated through the Sources panel where you map the files . DevTools directly has no knowledge of FTP/SFTP/FUSE mounts/etc . All it knows is local filesystem structures . So , if you use some software to mount a remote filesystem locally as a new folder or drive , then you can map it to DevTools just fine . I have done this myself in the past and have seen others do this setup as well . You simply need to research your OS and see what software is available that you are comfortable with to handle the mounting . Warning though , with large project file structures this can make things slow .",

    "text": "I am writing a Django project which will use Chrome Headless to produce PDF documents . There are lots of Apps , each of which will produce PDFs , so it made sense to have a class , that launches Chrome , makes a connection to it , and kills the Chrome process when the class is deleted . There will be a class method , which opens a new tab , renders some HTML , and returns the PDF data , and closes the tab . It seems slightly inefficient to create a new instance of the Class , every time I want to print a PDF ( which is the primary purpose of the project ) . It seems better to create a global instance of the Class , and have one copy of headless Chrome running the whole time , rather than starting Chrome , connecting to it , getting the PDF data , and then closing everything every time .

    "text": "I have a Server.js file i launch from the CMD : [CODE] The Server.js file creates an new instance of class A Class A creates a new instance of class B ( web socket ) and C ( REST API ) If the web socket connection is close/disconnected in class B then entire NodeJS app . simply stops/shuts down . Even though i have tried to \" start the entire process \" again ... by trying to place different code in in close event - like : The close event is called - but no matter - what and how i try to \" re-launch \" my app . it does n't execute my code - it just shuts down . I like to understand why and what is going on and not just to re-launch the entire app - by using NPM forever etc .. . UPDATE : Sorry for not making myself clear enough . But actually the details you are looking for is my bullet point no . 4 .. . literally no - i do n't execute the entire node app again .. . thats why i used \"\" ( quotes ) .. . as i described i try to start the process up again in the on . ( ' close' ) event handler ... i can debug and see when the code reach the point in the eventhandler ... but it does n't work to execute / call A.start() function again or via firering an event ... so its some thing about scopes , instances , function etc . i properly dont do correct - thats why i tried to describe the app , class , functions ... now - i hope its more clear what i mean :-) UPDATE 2 : Server.js [CODE] Download-manager.js [CODE] Wsclient.js [CODE] A node app will stay alive as long as there are active elements that can still receive events . This can include a TCP connection , a listening server , a timer , etc .. . As soon as none of those exist any more and the event queue is empty and the flow of control returns back to the system ( e.g . no JS is executing ) , then the node app will shut itself down . The idea is that if nothing is running that could possible create more events in the future , then there 's nothing else that can happen in this node app so it must be done . If you 're saying that when you try to run your app again , it wo n't start any more , then that is a different issue . You will need to do some logging of errors and debugging to figure out why that may be . If you just log every possible place you could get an error in your app start-up code , you will probably discover where the error is that is keeping it from starting . Since you 've provided not details that we could go on to know what issue might be preventing that , I can list some common things : Some process is still running that has control of some resource ( such as a port ) and when you try to restart your app , it shuts down when it ca n't access that resource . Some process is still running and has open file resources , restricting your ability to access those files . To start with , I 'd check your OS process manager to verify that your original app instance is not still running . The symptoms you describe make it sound like it is probably still running and holding onto some resources that keep your app from running again . This part has me confused when you say \" start the entire process again \" when your wed socket closes . Are you literally trying to exec node server.js again from within your app ? Or , what are you actually trying to do there ? We probably need to see that code to help you with that particular action . FYI , it should be no big deal to just re-establish a webSocket connection after it closed . You should n't have to restart your whole app just to do that .",

    "text": "Using mechanize , how can I wait for some time after page load ( some websites have a timer before links appear , like in download pages ) , and after the links have been loaded , click on a specific link ? Since it 's an anchor tag and not a submit button , will browser.submit() work ( I got errors while doing that ) ? Mechanize does not offer javascript functionality , so you will not see dynamic content ( like a timer that turns into a link ) . As far as clicking on a link , you have to find the element , and then you can call click_link on it . See the Finding Links section of this site . If you are looking for something to handle such sites , a good option is PhantomJS . It uses nodejs , but runs on the webkit engine , allowing you parse dynamic content . If you have your heart set on python , using Selenium to programatically drive a real browser may be your best bet . If it 's an anchor tag , then just GET/POST whatever it is . The timer between links appearing is generally done in javascript - some sites you are attempting to scrape may not be usable without javascript , or requires a token generated in javascript with clientside math . Depending on the site , you can either extract the wait time in msec/sec and time.sleep() for that long , or you 'll have to use something that can execute javascript",

    "text": "Given adjacency relation like [OUTPUT] How do I construct a graph of it . I want a easier implementation which can be understood by a beginner . I know about self referential structures . Please help Use proper abstraction level . You want to represent each node as an int with a set of neightbours ? [CODE] Why do n't you use Adjacency Matrix , it 's pretty simple and easy . Adjacency matrices are matrices which define relations between the vertices of a graph . See in the example above , you have an edge going from vertex 1 to 2 , so there is a 1 at the index [ 1 ] [ 2 ] of adjacency matrix , similar is the case with [ 1 ] [ 3 ] and so on . And you do n't have any edge going from 1 to 5 , so there is a 0 at index [ 1 ] [ 5 ] , and so on . You can also use Adjacency List , now go ahead and google it to have some understanding of how to use Adjacency Matrices and Adjacency Lists , and come back with some real problem then . EDIT I see , you do n't have any understanding of how to implement a graph , let me write some examples for you using Adjacency Matrix . I 'm assuming that you know how to allocate a 2D array in c++ . Now , if you want to create an adjacency matrix for a graph containing n vertices , simply create a 2D array of size n x n and initialize all of the elements in it with 0 . [CODE] There you go , call this function , and you 've created yourself an Adjacency Matrix . [CODE] Now , you can do whatever you want to do with your graph ( For now , it does n't have any edges ) . To have edges in it , simply place 1 wherever you want to put an edge . [CODE] Now , simply call this function , and add some edges to your graph . So i 'm gonna put some edges and create the above shown graph in it . [CODE] Now , you can do whatever you want with your graph , like should we calculate how many outgoing edges vertex 1 has ? For this , you can simply loop through the row 1 [CODE] At the end , you should de-allocate the allocated memory for adjacency graph . [CODE] So , i think by now , you 'd have much better understanding . I 've implemented the graph with using just the functions , and passing adjacency matrix to them ( my bad ) , I strongly recommend to implement the Graph in a class , which handles all of the Graph stuff itself , and you do n't have to pass adjacency matrix to it , you should n't even have to know whether the Graph class is implemented using Adjacency Matrix or some other method ( of course when using the class , not implementing it ) You class should be like this : [CODE] Now , go ahead and implement this class and add whatever functions you want in there .",

When you use Chrome and request the same resource in multiple tabs , it will wait for the resource to finish downloading in one . The reason is that if the headers allow , the second tab will load from cache , rather than reloading it from the server . This has nothing to do with your server configuration , but more to do with your flawed test method . Fire off a couple [CODE] calls from the command line , and this will likely work as expected . You can also verify that this is happening by using a debugging proxy , such as Fiddler , or packet sniffing software , such as Wireshark . What are your apache settings ?

I want to click on one of the recyclerview item . when i do this : [CODE] I get this exception : [CODE] any Ideas ? Uhm , i guess you are using the same xml file for every RecyclerView in your tabs . Hence all your RecyclerView 's have the same ID . So you ca n't refer to your RecyclerView 's using your ID 's . So either give every RecyclerView it 's own ID or try searching with any other ViewMatcher like withText ( \" any specific text in your recyclers \" ) . Here you may find methods that will work in your case . I 'd suggest to create the ViewHolder matcher to match specific item inside RecyclerView . Then you 'll be able to use PositionableRecyclerViewAction like scrollToHolder(...) for example : [CODE] And this is how I use it : [CODE]",

    "text": "I am running some image processing operations on GPU and I need the histogram of the output . I have written and tested the processing kernels . Also I have tested the histogram kernel for samples of the output pictures separately . They both work fine but when I put all of them in one loop I get nothing . This is my histogram kernel : [CODE] It is updating histogram vectors for red , green , and blue . ( ' l ' is the length of the vectors ) When I comment out atomicAdds it again produces the output but of course not the histogram . Why do n't they work together ? Edit : This is the loop : [CODE] Then I copy the output to host memory and write it to a video . These are c codes that only call their kernels with dimGrid and dimBlock that are given as inputs . Also : [CODE] I changed this for histogram because it worked better with it . Does it matter ? Edit2 : I am using [CODE] option for compilation . I just read it somewhere . Could anyone tell me how I should choose it ? perhaps you should try to compile without [CODE] flag . sm 1.1 is the first architecture which supported atomic operations on global memory while your GPU supports SM 2.0 . Hence there is no reason to compile for SM 1.1 unless for backward compatibility . One possible issue could be that SM 1.1 does not support atomic operations on 64-bit ints in global memory . So I would suggest you recompile the code without [CODE] option , or use [CODE] if you like",

Add an easy UIWebView connecting to the Url of the Faceboook page I want to show ; Implement the API I found in several answer all of you already gave in this forum . Thank you for your help Luigi The answer is \" it depends , \" but IMHO you 're asking the wrong question . A better question would be \" which method of integrating with FB would result in a better experience for my users ? \" That is , would your users be best served by \" framing \" the standard FB web interface in a UIWebView ? Or maybe they 'd be happier with just a small piece of FB functionality embedded in your app , like the \" upload to FB \" function in iMovie . Once you decide exactly what you want to do , how to do it tends to be fairly obvious . Which way to go depends on what your app does , and how your users will want to do it - and you know that part far better than the rest of us do ! :-) I 've answered something similar here : ShareKit iOS - different content for different platforms Basically , I used ShareKit which is very popular and indeed was a breeze to add .
