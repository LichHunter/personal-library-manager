End-to-end latency: < 100ms (P99) ### Resource Utilization **CPU Utilization** (Target: 60-70% average): - API Gateway: 55% average, 80% peak - Workflow Engine: 65% average, 85% peak - Auth Service: 40% average, 60% peak **Memory Utilization** (Target: < 80%): - API Gateway: 2.5GB average per pod (4GB allocated) - Workflow Engine: 6GB average per pod (8GB allocated) - Notification Service: 2.8GB average per pod (4GB allocated) **Network Throughput**: - Ingress: 2 Gbps average, 5 Gbps peak - Egress: 1.5 Gbps average, 4 Gbps peak - Internal (service mesh): 8 Gbps average ### Monitoring & Alerting **Key Metrics** (Monitored via Prometheus): - Request rate (per service, per endpoint) - Error rate (4xx, 5xx responses) - Latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99) - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk) - Cache hit/miss ratios - Database connection pool saturation - Kafka consumer lag **Alerts** (via PagerDuty): - P1 (Immediate): API error rate > 1%, database connection failure - P2 (< 15 min): P99 latency > 500ms, cache hit rate < 80% - P3 (< 1 hour): Resource utilization > 85%, replica count < minimum **SLI/SLO/SLA**: - SLI: API success rate (non-5xx responses) - SLO: 99.9% uptime per month (43 minutes downtime allowance) - SLA: 99.5% uptime guarantee (customer-facing SLA with credits) --- ## Disaster Recovery ### Recovery Objectives **RPO (Recovery Point Objective): 1 hour** - Maximum acceptable data loss: 1 hour of transactions - Achieved through: Continuous database replication + hourly snapshots - Kafka retention: 7 days allows event replay **RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 4 hours** - Maximum acceptable downtime: 4 hours for full system recovery - Includes: Failover, data verification, and service restoration - Automated runbooks reduce RTO to < 2 hours for common scenarios ### High Availability Architecture **Multi-AZ Deployment**: ``` Region: us-east-1 AZ-1a: AZ-1b: AZ-1c: -
