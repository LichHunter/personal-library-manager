If you need more steps, consider splitting into multiple workflows connected via webhooks. ### Execution Timeout - **Default**: 3600 seconds (60 minutes) - **Behavior**: Workflows exceeding this timeout are automatically terminated - **Custom Timeouts**: Enterprise plans can request custom timeout limits **Setting Step-Level Timeouts:** ```yaml - id: long_running_task action: http_request config: url: \"https://api.example.com/process\" timeout: 300 # 5 minutes for this specific step ``` ### Execution Limits - **Maximum**: 1000 executions per day (per workflow) - **Rate Limiting**: 100 concurrent executions per workflow - **Burst Limit**: 10 executions per second **What happens when limits are reached:** - New executions are queued automatically - Webhook triggers return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) - Scheduled executions are skipped (logged in audit trail) - Email notifications sent to workflow owner **Monitoring Usage:** View real-time metrics in your workflow dashboard: - Executions today: 847 / 1000 - Average duration: 12.3s - Success rate: 98.2% - Current queue depth: 3 ### Data Limits - **Maximum request/response size**: 10MB per action - **Maximum execution payload**: 50MB total - **Variable value size**: 1MB per variable ### Enterprise Plan Limits Enterprise customers can request increased limits: - Up to 100 steps per workflow - Up to 10,000 executions per day - Up to 7200 second timeout (2 hours) - Priority execution queue - Dedicated capacity allocation Contact sales@cloudflow.io for Enterprise pricing and custom limits. ## Best Practices Follow these best practices to build reliable, maintainable workflows: ### 1.
