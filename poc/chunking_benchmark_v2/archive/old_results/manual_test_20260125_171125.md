## Detailed Findings

### Question 1: What is the default timeout for CloudFlow workflows?

**Expected Answer**: Workflows exceeding 3600 seconds (60 minutes) are automatically terminated

**Score**: 5/10 (PARTIAL)

**Explanation**: The retrieved content lacks a direct statement about the default timeout for CloudFlow workflows. While the first chunk suggests workflow timeout can be modified (implying an existing default), it does not specify the 3600 seconds (60 minutes) standard timeout. The retrieved information is tangentially related to workflow configuration but does not definitively answer the specific question about the default timeout duration.

### Question 2: How many steps can I have in a single workflow?

**Expected Answer**: Maximum: 50 steps per workflow

**Score**: 3/10 (FAIL)

**Explanation**: No retrieved content directly answers the specific question about the maximum number of steps in a single workflow. None of the retrieved chunks provide information about workflow step limits. The content covers workflow configuration, rate limiting, and troubleshooting, but does not address the specific step count constraint. The retrieved information is mostly unrelated to the direct query.

### Question 3: What are the authentication methods supported by CloudFlow?

**Expected Answer**: CloudFlow supports three authentication methods: API Keys, OAuth 2.0, and JWT Tokens

**Score**: 7/10 (PASS)

**Explanation**: The retrieved content partially references the authentication methods for CloudFlow. Chunk 1 starts to describe authentication methods but is cut off mid-sentence. While the full list isn't explicitly shown, the content suggests authentication is a key topic and hints at multiple methods. The interruption prevents a perfect score, but there's clear relevance to the authentication question.

### Question 4: How do I troubleshoot database connection pool exhaustion?

**Expected Answer**: Check current connection pool status using 'cloudflow db pool status --detailed'

**Score**: 6/10 (PARTIAL)

**Explanation**: The retrieved content contains a partial reference to connection-related issues in Chunk 1, which starts with '2. Connection Pool Leaks' and seems to suggest checking active connections. However, it does not provide the specific command mentioned in the expected answer ('cloudflow db pool status --detailed'). The content is tangentially related to database connections but lacks a direct, complete troubleshooting solution. While there's some relevance, the answer is incomplete and requires significant additional context to be fully actionable.

### Question 5: What is the retry policy for workflow actions?

**Expected Answer**: Max retries: 3, Initial delay: 1 second, Backoff multiplier: 2, Max delay: 60 seconds

**Score**: 6/10 (PARTIAL)

**Explanation**: The retrieved content hints at retry policies with mentions of error handling and retries, but does not fully specify the precise retry parameters requested. Chunk 1 shows a partial context of retry configuration with 'Configure automatic retries for failed actions', but lacks the specific details of max retries, initial delay, backoff multiplier, and max delay. No direct match to the exact retry policy parameters exists in the retrieved chunks.

### Question 6: How long are JWT tokens valid?

**Expected Answer**: All tokens expire after 3600 seconds (1 hour). Implement token refresh logic in your application.

**Score**: 5/10 (PARTIAL)

**Explanation**: The retrieved content contains tangentially related information about JWT tokens but does not directly answer the specific question about token validity duration. Chunk 4 shows some JWT token time-related diagnostics, and Chunk 5 references 'short-lived' tokens in cache strategies (5-15 minutes), but no explicit statement about the standard 1-hour (3600 seconds) expiration is present. While the content is in the JWT/authentication domain, it lacks a clear, direct answer to the token validity timeframe.

## Conclusion

✗ **INVALIDATED**: Average score of 5.3/10 is below the validation threshold (<5.5). The enriched_hybrid_llm strategy shows insufficient retrieval performance. The 88.7% coverage benchmark claim appears to be overstated.
