## Detailed Findings

### Question 1: What is the default rate limit for the CloudFlow API?

**Expected Answer**: 100 requests per minute per authenticated user, 20 requests per minute for unauthenticated requests, with a burst allowance of 150 requests in a 10-second window

**Score**: 10/10 (PASS)

**Explanation**: The retrieved content contains a perfect, verbatim match to the expected answer in Chunk 1. The API reference document explicitly states the rate limit details: '100 requests per minute per authenticated user, 20 requests per minute for unauthenticated requests, with a burst allowance of 150 requests in a 10-second window'. The information is clear, direct, and precisely matches the expected answer without any ambiguity.

### Question 2: How long do CloudFlow access tokens last?

**Expected Answer**: All tokens expire after 3600 seconds (1 hour). Implement token refresh logic in your application.

**Score**: 5/10 (PARTIAL)

**Explanation**: While the retrieved content includes documentation about CloudFlow and mentions authentication, there is no explicit confirmation of the access token duration. The 'Cache Invalidation Strategies' section hints at token lifetimes (5-15 minutes for short-lived data), but does not directly state the 1-hour token expiration. The token validation is mentioned in the architecture overview, but no specific duration is provided. The retrieval fails to confidently answer the precise question about CloudFlow access token lifetime.

### Question 3: What happens when I exceed the CloudFlow API rate limit?

**Expected Answer**: When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a JSON error object that includes a retry_after value indicating how long to wait before making another request

**Score**: 9/10 (PASS)

**Explanation**: The retrieved content directly addresses rate limit behavior in chunk 3, specifying that CloudFlow enforces rate limits with 100 requests per minute for authenticated users. Chunk 4 provides additional context about handling rate limit errors, mentioning retry mechanisms and checking remaining requests. The retrieval includes the critical details about receiving a rate limit response when limits are exceeded. The answer precisely matches the expected response about getting a 429 status and retry_after guidance.

### Question 4: How can I handle rate limiting in my CloudFlow API calls?

**Expected Answer**: Best practices include monitoring `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header values, implementing exponential backoff when receiving 429 responses, caching responses when appropriate, and considering upgrading to Enterprise tier for higher limits

**Score**: 9/10 (PASS)

**Explanation**: The retrieved content contains highly relevant information about CloudFlow's rate limiting, directly addressing the question. Chunk 2 provides precise details about rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Remaining) and default limits. Chunk 3 demonstrates a practical implementation of rate limit handling with retry and warning logic. The content covers monitoring headers, understanding limits, and implementing exponential backoff. While the answer isn't perfectly structured, all key elements of the expected answer are present: header monitoring, handling 429 responses, and awareness of rate limits. The only reason it's not a perfect 10 is slight lack of explicit discussion of response caching and enterprise tier upgrades.

### Question 5: What are the authentication methods supported by CloudFlow?

**Expected Answer**: CloudFlow supports three authentication methods: API Keys, OAuth 2.0, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with RS256 signing algorithm

**Score**: 6/10 (PARTIAL)

**Explanation**: The retrieved content hints at authentication but does not fully articulate the three specific authentication methods. Chunk 1 starts to discuss authentication but is cut off before revealing the full details. There's no clear confirmation of API Keys, OAuth 2.0, and JWT being the supported methods. While authentication is mentioned, the specific requested details are not comprehensively retrieved, leaving significant gaps in the answer.
