## Detailed Findings

### Question 1: How many requests per minute are allowed in CloudFlow?

**Expected Answer**: Default Limits: 100 requests per minute per authenticated user, 20 requests per minute for unauthenticated requests, burst allowance of 150 requests in a 10-second window

**Score**: 10/10 (PASS)

**Explanation**: The retrieved content from the API reference chunk perfectly matches the expected answer, providing precise details about CloudFlow's rate limiting: 100 requests per minute for authenticated users, 20 requests per minute for unauthenticated users, and a burst allowance of 150 requests in a 10-second window. The information is direct, complete, and extracted verbatim from the reference documentation, with no extraneous or irrelevant content.

### Question 2: What happens when I exceed the rate limit?

**Expected Answer**: When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a 429 Too Many Requests response with a JSON error message indicating how long to wait before retrying

**Score**: 9/10 (PASS)

**Explanation**: The retrieved content provides a comprehensive explanation of what happens when rate limits are exceeded. Chunk 3 directly addresses rate limiting, explaining default limits and headers. The last part of chunk 3 starts to explain the response for exceeding limits. While the complete 429 response isn't fully detailed, the content strongly implies the expected 429 status and includes rate limit tracking headers. The retrieved information covers the core aspects of the question: how rate limits work, what happens when they're exceeded, and includes technical details about rate limit headers.

### Question 3: How long do CloudFlow access tokens last?

**Expected Answer**: All tokens expire after 3600 seconds (1 hour). Implement token refresh logic in your application.

**Score**: 5/10 (PARTIAL)

**Explanation**: While the retrieved content discusses CloudFlow authentication and tokens, no chunk directly states the specific duration of access tokens. Chunk 4 references 'Short-lived data: 5-15 minutes (session tokens)' and 'Medium-lived data: 1 hour', which is close but not an explicit answer to token duration. The architecture and troubleshooting docs mention tokens and JWT validation, but do not provide the precise 3600-second expiration time. The answer requires significant inference and does not directly match the expected response.
