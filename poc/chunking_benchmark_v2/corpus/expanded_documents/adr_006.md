# ADR-006: Use Terraform for Infrastructure as Code

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2024-11-24

## Context

We need a way to manage cloud infrastructure consistently across environments.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Terraform

Multi-cloud IaC tool.

**Pros:**
- Multi-cloud support
- Large community
- State management
- Plan before apply

**Cons:**
- State file management
- Learning curve
- HCL limitations

### Option 2: AWS CloudFormation

AWS-native IaC.

**Pros:**
- Native AWS support
- No state file
- Drift detection

**Cons:**
- AWS only
- Verbose YAML/JSON
- Slower development

### Option 3: Pulumi

IaC with real programming languages.

**Pros:**
- Real languages
- Type safety
- Reusable components

**Cons:**
- Smaller community
- Vendor lock-in
- Commercial features

## Decision

We will use Terraform with S3 backend for state and DynamoDB for locking.

## Consequences

- Implement module structure
- Use workspaces for environments
- Automate with Atlantis
