# ADR-002: Adopt Kubernetes for Container Orchestration

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2024-01-24

## Context

We need a platform to deploy and scale our microservices. The platform must support auto-scaling, rolling deployments, and multi-region deployment.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Kubernetes (EKS)

Industry-standard container orchestration.

**Pros:**
- Industry standard
- Rich ecosystem
- Cloud agnostic
- Auto-scaling

**Cons:**
- Operational complexity
- Learning curve
- Resource overhead

### Option 2: AWS ECS

Amazon's native container service.

**Pros:**
- Simple operation
- Native AWS integration
- Lower overhead

**Cons:**
- AWS lock-in
- Less flexible
- Smaller community

### Option 3: Serverless (Lambda)

Function-as-a-service approach.

**Pros:**
- Zero infrastructure
- Pay per use
- Auto-scaling

**Cons:**
- Cold starts
- 15-minute limit
- Vendor lock-in

## Decision

We will use Kubernetes on EKS for container orchestration with Helm for deployments.

## Consequences

- Need platform team expertise
- Implement GitOps with ArgoCD
- Use managed node groups for easier operations
