## Detailed Findings

### Question 1: What is the default rate limit for CloudFlow API?

**Expected Answer**: 100 requests per minute per authenticated user, 20 requests per minute for unauthenticated requests, with a burst allowance of 150 requests in a 10-second window

**Score**: 0/10 (FAIL)

**Explanation**: Grading failed

### Question 2: How do I handle 429 Too Many Requests errors from the CloudFlow API?

**Expected Answer**: When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a 429 Too Many Requests response with a JSON error object indicating retry details. Implement exponential backoff and monitor the X-RateLimit-Remaining header.

**Score**: 0/10 (FAIL)

## Conclusion

✗ **INVALIDATED**: Average score of 0.0/10 is below the validation threshold (<5.5). The enriched_hybrid_llm strategy shows insufficient retrieval performance. The 88.7% coverage benchmark claim appears to be overstated.
