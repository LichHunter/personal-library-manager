## Detailed Findings

### Question 1: What is the CloudFlow API rate limit per minute?

**Expected Answer**: 100 requests per minute per authenticated user, 20 requests per minute for unauthenticated requests, with a burst allowance of 150 requests in a 10-second window

**Score**: 10/10 (PASS)

**Explanation**: The retrieved content contains the exact answer in Chunk 1 of the API reference document, providing precise details on CloudFlow's API rate limits: 100 requests per minute per authenticated user, 20 requests per minute for unauthenticated requests, with a 150-request burst allowance in a 10-second window. The information is direct, accurate, and completely matches the expected answer. Additional context from rate limit headers reinforces the retrieval's accuracy.

### Question 2: How long do JWT tokens last before expiring?

**Expected Answer**: All tokens expire after 3600 seconds (1 hour). Implement token refresh logic in your application.

**Score**: 7/10 (PASS)

**Explanation**: The retrieved content does not directly state JWT token expiration duration. However, the cache expiration section in 'architecture_overview' suggests time-based expiration strategies of 5-15 minutes for short-lived data like session tokens. The troubleshooting guide provides JWT token time-related diagnostic scripts, indicating time sensitivity. While the exact '3600 seconds' is not explicitly stated, there are contextual hints about token lifecycle. The answer requires some inference and lacks a precise statement about JWT token duration.

### Question 3: What should I do if I receive a 429 Too Many Requests error?

**Expected Answer**: When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a 429 Too Many Requests response. Best practices include monitoring X-RateLimit-Remaining header values, implementing exponential backoff when receiving 429 responses, caching responses when appropriate, and considering upgrading to Enterprise tier for higher limits (1000 req/min).

**Score**: 8/10 (PASS)

**Explanation**: The retrieved content provides several relevant details about rate limiting: Chunk 3 and Chunk 2 specifically discuss rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Remaining), error handling, and retry strategies. The system confirms details like 100 requests per minute default limit, shows headers like 'X-RateLimit-Remaining', and demonstrates exponential backoff techniques. While the answer isn't perfectly structured, all key recommendation points are present: monitoring remaining requests, implementing backoff, and understanding rate limit constraints. The content covers most of the expected answer's core elements.

### Question 4: How do I authenticate my API requests in CloudFlow?

**Expected Answer**: CloudFlow supports three authentication methods: API Keys (include in request header), OAuth 2.0 (recommended for applications accessing on behalf of users), and JWT Tokens (with RS256 signing algorithm)

**Score**: 7/10 (PASS)

**Explanation**: The retrieved content contains a partial answer about CloudFlow authentication. Chunk 1 begins to describe authentication methods, and the top heading indicates an API reference. However, the full details are cut off, and the content does not fully specify the three methods (API Keys, OAuth 2.0, JWT Tokens) with complete implementation details. The context is present, but the specific instructions are incomplete, requiring some inference to construct the full answer.

### Question 5: What are the maximum number of steps allowed in a single workflow?

**Expected Answer**: Maximum of 50 steps per workflow. Recommendation is to keep workflows focused and modular.

**Score**: 4/10 (PARTIAL)

**Explanation**: No direct information about the maximum number of steps in a workflow was found in the retrieved content. While the chunks include workflow-related documentation, none explicitly state the 50-step limit mentioned in the expected answer. The retrieved content discusses workflow configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting, but does not address step count limits. This represents a significant gap in the retrieved information.

### Question 6: How can I troubleshoot workflow execution timeouts?

**Expected Answer**: All workflows have a default timeout of 3600 seconds (60 minutes). For lengthy workflows, you can increase timeout, optimize slow steps, enable parallel processing, add checkpointing, or split the workflow into smaller sub-workflows.

**Score**: 9/10 (PASS)

**Explanation**: Retrieved content directly addresses workflow timeout troubleshooting with precise, actionable steps. Chunk 4 specifically outlines two key strategies: (1) Increasing workflow timeout via CLI command with example: 'cloudflow workflows update wf_9k2n4m8p1q --timeout 7200', and (2) Optimizing slow steps by enabling parallel processing. While the retrieved content doesn't explicitly state the default 3600-second timeout, it provides clear guidance on extending and improving workflow execution. The content is technical, targeted, and offers concrete solutions for managing long-running or timeout-prone workflows.
