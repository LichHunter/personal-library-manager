# Phase 4 Summary: Main Experiment Execution

## Objective

Run all 1080 extraction conditions (45 chunks × 2 models × 4 variants × 3 trials).

## Approach

1. Loaded ground truth with 45 annotated chunks
2. Ran extraction for each model-variant-trial combination
3. Calculated metrics for each extraction
4. Saved all raw results for analysis

## Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total conditions | 1080 |
| Completed | 1080 |
| Failed | 0 |
| Duration | 79.6 minutes |

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

- [x] All conditions executed
- [x] Raw results saved to artifacts
- [x] Ready for Phase 5: Analysis and Reporting

**Phase 4 Status: COMPLETE**
