I want the img to be larger than the container . I can set a width for the img which is larger with [CODE] However it no longer is responsive vs [CODE] I want the img to resize as I resize the browser , I was hoping to do it without media queries but if necessary I will do so . I am already changing the size of all the p tags so that my blockquote is the size of the container section , and I want my image to do the same , but it is just the size of the p tag . My main concern is making the img responsive and larger , I can already make it larger on its own with a specified width , but it no longer stays responsive . Thanks in advance . CODE HTML [CODE] CSS [CODE] You are setting 100% width too image , but also giving it borders . This causes problem . You need to subtract amount of border from image . Try : [CODE] Fiddle here . I do n't think you should have a div of a certain size and and then an element within that which then breaks out of the div because you 've set it to be larger then the [CODE] First thing I would do is reorganize the way that container works . Here is a FIDDLE of some basic html to reference . The second thing I would do - is ask a more targeted question about removing the automatic p tag from the image in a ghost forum ( assuming they exist by now ) . In WordPress this happens by default as well . It looks something like this with a function running a regular expression search and replace . I bet there is something like this for ghost , or there will be really really soon - because it 's a huge pain - and almost no one actually puts images inline anymore . And if they did , they would want to control when this happens . [CODE] Good luck ! I hope to play with Ghost soon and I bet this will be the first problem I run into as well .",

Every row in the UITableView is supposed to have the grey button when the UITableView first loads , and then if a user taps a button then it switches to the red version of the button . For some reason , about 80% of the time when I load the view controller with this UITableView on my iPhone , the first 2 rows in the first section will not have a button . What 's weird is if I tap my finger where the button is supposed to be 2 things happen : The functionality attached to the button works and NSLogs in the console in xcode . The red button appears . So it 's like the grey button is there , it 's just invisible . This does n't work because if a user sees 2 rows without a button they are going to think something is broken or that they ca n't tap on that row . Also , if I scroll to the very bottom of my UITableView , and then scroll back up again , the invisible grey buttons will magically appear like they were there the whole time . Here are the first 3 method implementations that are involved in creating my UITableView : [CODE] And then here is my cellForRowAtIndexPath method implementation which does most of the work in creating the UITableView and which actually creates the UIButton settings for each row . The [CODE] statement really has 2 sets of nearly identical code , the only difference is one is for section 1 of the table view and the other is for section 2 : [CODE] I have not included the full method implementations that these 2 statements trigger because they only handle the functionality attached to each button , and most likely have nothing to do with this issue , but I will post them here anyways . These 2 statements can be found in the [CODE] for cellForRowAtIndexPath and handle the touch events for the 2 sections of the table view : [CODE] I see the pattern of trying to set up a custom UITableViewCell from within tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath : quite a lot . The trouble is that I believe it to be the wrong place to do it . If you 're really only using a built-in UITableViewCell , then it 's the right place ; for custom cells , it 's not . I 'd recommend making a UITableViewCell subclass with a \" setup \" method that takes an object and uses that object to set up the cell 's UI . For instance , take section 0 from your UITableView . I 'd do something like this : [CODE] This way , you can set up the cell 's layout as well as images for the button in IB , rather than code . This also makes the code a lot easier to read ( and re-read 6 months later ! ) . Also , unless the 2 cells ( section 0 and section 1) are really interchangeable , I 'd recommend two different subclasses of UITableViewCell to give you greater control , rather than trying to force one to act like the other or vice versa . Then , you simply assign different identifiers and recycle the appropriate type .",

    "text": "I have the following code for a CUDA program : [CODE] in which every thread will print its threadIdx.x and blockIdx.x . One possible output of this program is this : [CODE] Running the program several times I get similar results , except that block order is random . For example , in the above output we have this block order 0 , 2 , 3 , 1 . Running the problem again I get 1 , 2 , 3 , 0 . This is expected . However , the thread order in every block is always 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 . Why is this happening ? I thought it would be random too . I tried to change my code to force thread 0 in every block to take longer to execute . I did it like this : [CODE] I would expect thread order to be 1 , 2 , 3 , 0 . However , I got a similar result to the one I have shown above where thread order was always 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 . Why is this happening ? [OUTPUT] With 4 threads per block you are only launching one warp per block . A warp is the unit of execution ( and scheduling , and resource assignment ) in CUDA , not a thread . Currently , a warp consists of 32 threads . This means that all 4 of your threads per block ( since there is no conditional behavior in this case ) are executing in lockstep . When they reach the printf function call , they all execute the call to that function in the same line of code , in lockstep . So the question becomes , in this situation , how does the CUDA runtime dispatch these \" simultaneous \" function calls ? The answer to that question is unspecified , but it is not \" random \" . Therefore it 's reasonable that the order of dispatch for operations within a warp does not change from run to run . If you launch enough threads to create multiple warps per block , and probably also include some other code to disperse and or \" randomize \" the behavior between warps , you should be able to see printf operations emanating from separate warps occurring in \" random \" order . To answer the second part of your question , when control flow diverges at the [CODE] statement , the threads where [CODE] simply wait to at the convergence point after the [CODE] statement . They do not go on to the printf statement until thread 0 has completed the [CODE] block .",

Should i have same controller on the other app ? How can i connect and send http request and receive response ? Thanks in advance For such a simple example , you can do something as simple as : [CODE] However , you 're most likely going to want to deal with more complicated JSON responses , so before long you 'll probably want to use something like the Jbuilder gem or ActiveModel Serializers ( my preferred approach ) . On the other end , your front-end will need to make an HTTP GET request . Lots of ways ( and gems ) to do this , but one common approach is just to use the built in Net::HTTP class . [CODE] In your situation , a better approach might be to use the Active Resource gem . This gem allows you to create models that are backed by a REST API rather than a database . For example , if your API app provides basic Create-Read-Update-Destroy actions for a particular model ( let 's call it Widget ) at the following URLs : [CODE] then in your front-end app you could declare an Active Resource like this : [CODE] which will auto-magically access all of those methods in your API , and behave much like a regular Active Record model . That way , you basically design your front-end app like a \" normal \" rails app , but using ActiveResource-based models in place of ActiveRecord . I would note , however , that a more common thing to do these days would be to build your API in Rails , and build your front-end with client-side Javascript , using something like JQuery or Angular to make requests from the API . I 'm not sure what you 're gaining by splitting API and front-end , where both of them are Rails apps - unless you 've got a compelling reason , I 'd just build one Rails app that handles both API and front-end , or build a Rails API + Angular ( or similar ) front-end .",

The document I can find seems only handle my first case ( which is already done ) . Thanks Create a sub-domain \" mail.mycompany.com \" and redirect it to \" mycompany.awsapps.com \" . I resolved this by using the built-in CloudFront interface . I admit the documentation on this is pretty poor , but the aim behind it is to get people to pay for this redirection . To have your mywebmail.mydomain.com mapped into myaws.awsapps.com/workmail then please follow the steps below : 1) You might have done this step already : On your DNS server ( where that is ) , create a CNAME to map mywebmail.mydomain.com into myaws.awsapps.com 2) Login into your CloudFront interface https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/ 3) Click on \" Create Distribution \" 4) On the Origin-Domain put myaws.awsapps.com 5) On the Origin-URI put /workmail 6 ) Adjust the setting to what you like such as redirecting from HTTP into HTTPS or use as-is etc . 7 ) Scroll down to the CNAME and enter the aliases you need , for this example you need to put in mywebmail.mydomain.com 8 ) Save 9 ) Notice that this might take a while to get created , mine took about 30 minutes to complete , also every time I needed to edit something it would take around 10-20 minutes to complete . 10 ) Once done , browse your mywebmail.mydomain.com , your CNAME on your original DNS ( step 1 above ) should ask your browser to redirect and then with AWS CloundFront setting it would add the URI afterwards , 1 1) If you get a blank page , then check your headers , in particular ( ? organization = YourDomainName ) , you might need to manually add it there from the behaviours menu of the item you created above .

This might sound confusing at first but that 's the magic of prototypes in JavaScript . This is the caveat of prototypal inheritance . Anything on the prototype will be passed down to each instance . To maintain different instances of the attribute we initialise our object 's attributes in the constructor . When working with objects in JS ( like arrays ) , they are passed by reference . To make use of JS 's prototype system I would suggest something like so : [CODE] This way we reuse the methods from the \" parent \" and have a localised array in our \" child \" . At a first glance this might look as a classic OOP inheritance case but it is a bit different . If you want to read more about prototypes in JS I recommend this article Hope this helps .",

The first getline() is called in the userStringPrompt() function : [CODE] That sets a string that the program will use later to perform functions , like count its consonants , its vowels , etc . The second input is used in the menu selection ( choose what function/method to perform on the above string ) : [CODE] This takes in a user input : A , B , C , D , E and performs an action . For example , if a user inputs into the first input stream : [OUTPUT] and then enter \" A \" in the second input stream , it should count the vowels in hello , then return the number from the calculation , e.g . 2 The issue : The program functions correctly when the input in userStringPrompt is without spaces . For example , Hello works , but Hello World would break the application and cause a force close . I 'm not sure why , since I am capturing the stream with getline(cin, string) . The entire code : [CODE] Any guidance/hints would be greatly appreciated . I 'm absolutely confused . I guess your program is not crushing , it 's just normally exits . [CODE] which is ok , no error code returned . When you run your program it asks for input , do its work and because there is no more work for it - exits . To see the output you can do one of the following : Try to run it with Ctrl + F5 in VS , it will add [CODE] command to the end . Another way to run it is to open command line and run it from there . Also in your case I guess the problem is in [CODE] statements . When you choose what to do with the string you break your loop ( which should run while user enters e ) .

    "text": "Can someone explain me why this is happening ? Silverlight 4 application using WCF Ria Services SL app calls StartLongOperation [CODE] operation . Due to synchronization issues with external components there is a Thread.Sleep ( 30 * 1000 ) in the server-side code . SL app calls GetStatus ( standard query ) operation . These calls appear to be blocked server-side and are waiting for the StartLongOperation to complete . Why ? ? I was assuming that serverside , the StartLongOperation runs an a worker thread and each call to GetStatus would run on a seperate worker thread . Client-side the calls are async so SL fires off the StartLongOperation and then continues to poll the GetStatus . But the GetStatusCompleted does n't get fired until the StartLongOperation has completed . Since all Silverlight network communication happens on the UI thread , only one WCF call can happen at a time . Meaning your StartLongOperation has to complete , and then the client will start the GetStatus call . If you want to test this behavior , fire up Fiddler . You will find that Silverlight will not send an HTTP request to the GetStatus method until it first gets a StartLongOperation response from the server . So the problem is n't server-side . It 's a limitation of Silverlight .",

I think JWT authentication is what you 're looking for .

    "text": "I 've created a bash script to find dollar words . For those of you who do n't know , a dollar word is a word whose values of their letters add up to 100 when A is given a value of 1 , B is given a value of 2 , C is 3 , and all the way to Z is 26 . I am new to programming , so I 've created a very crude script that 'll do this kind of thing , but it 's not working as fast as I would expect . Something in my code is slowing it down , but I do n't know what . This is my code . [CODE] I can only speculate that it has something to do with the [CODE] loops , or with how it is constantly writing the value of $line to a file . I 've created a script before that adds numbers to generate the Fibonacci sequence , and it does it almost instantaneously . So my question is , what are some ways to help my code run more efficiently ? Apologies if this belongs on codereview . Any help is highly appreciated . Thanks Edit : Although I accepted Gordan Davisson 's Answer , the other ones are just as good if you want to do this . I 'd recommend reading everyone else 's answer before giving this a try . Also , as numerous users have pointed out , bash is not a good language to be using for this . Again , Thanks to everyone for your suggestions . As @thatotherguy pointed out in a comment , there are two big problems here . First , the way you 're reading lines from the file reads the entire file every line . That is , to read the first line you run [CODE] , which reads the entire file and prints only the first line ; then you run [CODE] , which reads the entire file again and prints only the second line ; etc . To fix this use a [CODE] read loop : [CODE] Note that if anything inside the loop tries to read from standard input , it 'll steal some of the input from Words.txt . In that case you can send the file over FD #3 instead of standard input with [CODE] . The second problem is this bit : [CODE] which .. creates 3 subprocesses ( [CODE] , [CODE] , and [CODE] ) , which is n't too bad except that this runs 26 times for each and every word in the file . Creating processes is expensive compared to most shell operations , so you should do your best to avoid it especially in loops that run many many times . Try this instead : [CODE] This works by replacing all characters that are n't ${letter[i]} with \"\" , then looking at the length of the resulting string . The parsing happens entirely in the shell process , so it should be much faster . Given : [CODE] ( i.e . , the 370,101 word file linked HERE ) In Bash alone , start with a loop that reads the file line by line : [CODE] To count the lines alone in Bash ( same file ) takes over 7.8 seconds on my computer . [CODE] in comparison executes in microseconds . So the Bash version is going to take a while . Once you have the file word by word , you can read each word character by character and find the index of that character in a string of the alphabet : [CODE] Prints : [CODE] That takes about 1:55 on the 370,101 word file . As a comparison , consider the same function in Python : [CODE] Far easier to understand and executes in 580 ms . Bash is great for gluing together different tools . Is is not that great at large processing tasks . Use awk perl python ruby etc for larger tasks . Easier to write , read , understand and faster .",

    "text": "Context In a C# Windows Forms application for Win7 we host an ActiveX control . So far , so good . Need : prevent ActiveX to receive mouse events Actually , the ActiveX has too much functionality . It is not very customizable to turn off features we do n't need . It would be nice if we just prevented it from receiving mouse events . The ideal would be to just treat events as if the ActiveX was not there , that is the mouse clicks go right through to the underlying ( or containing ) Control . But if we just prevent the ActiveX from getting events that would be okay with us . Search before you ask Some answers to previous questions mention to [CODE] , e.g . c# - Pass-through mouse events to parent control - Stack Overflow Other mentions to implement IMessageFilters , e.g . : winforms - C# Application-Wide Left Mouse Click Event - Stack Overflow winforms - Handling a click event anywhere inside a panel in C# - Stack Overflow winforms - C# Application-Wide Left Mouse Click Event - Stack Overflow Capturing Mouse Events from every component on C# WInForm - Stack Overflow Experiment : ActiveX still gets events I have fairly extensively tried both override WndProc and IMessageFilter ways , filtering ( opt-in and opt-out ) a number of events . In some cases I can prevent events to reach native C# controls , but the ActiveX still got its share . Filtering too much , prevented controls and ActiveX to paint , or even application to draw properly or caused crash on exit . This can be averted by selecting opt-in or opt-out options carefully . Is there another way ? Is there another way from C# /.NET to host an ActiveX Control while preventing it from getting mouse events ? Perhaps at application start time ? Try to do a EnableWindow(hand,FALSE) on the uppermost hwnd of the ActiveX Control after has been created . See Using Window Handle to disable Mouse clicks using c# how to do this in c# .",

So , if I search : 2041 it should return an array ( \" 318 500 358 865 \" ) or if I search : 1818 it should return an array ( \" 920 898 \" , \" 31 470 725 358 114 56 9 55 \" ) . I also need solution to be optimal , because string of numbers can sum up to hundreds of thousands . Principle explained in theory would be good , but preferred languages are PHP or NodeJs if solution is given by programming language . Even MySQL solution would be nice , if possible . But solution by any language would be nice anyway . Extra notes numbers are all positive integers number values are between 1-10000 Here you go , in Python . This has linear complexity : [CODE] I 'm assuming there are no negative values in your list , and the list consists purely of integers separated by spaces . You should n't have any problems translating it into any other language . I hope the algorithm is self-explanatory , if not ask . Usage : [CODE] First we pass the string we want to search , then we use method to_array() so we can create the array from the string , then you need to choose which mode you want to use . It has 2 modes , soft search and hard search . you can choose which one to use in the find method , [CODE] , [CODE] mode , [CODE] mode ; The soft mode it is really simple , creates a new multidimensional array with keys as the strlen of the numbers ( method order()) , so if we are searching for a number 70 we do n't really wanna use the 3 digits or more , i mean ( 100 , 99999 etc .. . ) . Then it just minus the search value with the number and tries to search in the entire array with ( in_array ) if it has the result ; [CODE] The hard mode is just as the name states , we will loop through every number . [CODE] Of course we could really make a few more tweaks but from what i tested it gives good results . Feel free to ask if you have any questions .

While you could bind to each button individually , as in Deryck 's answer , often times such practice leads to duplicate code . Its likely your actual use case is n't to log 3 different things to the console when 3 buttons are clicked . Particularly if these 3 buttons do similar actions or if they act on the same set of data , its often much more clean to do something like this : jQuery [CODE] Markup [CODE] Reference On calling .on() for event binding Each item in a set will have an [CODE] number and you can use that to identify them . jQuery : [CODE] The .eq() method means \" equals \" and refers to the index number for the selector you chose in [CODE] .

Of course , you would replace eq(0) with whatever number you want to use to identify the button ( starting from 0 being the first element in the set , not greater than [CODE] .
