    "text": "I have following code . Why do all the three objects refer to the same array while the string variable is independent ? How can I fix it without explicitly adding : [CODE] [CODE] [CODE] [CODE] [CODE] An explanation would be : Prototypes are live chains between objects . Because B 's prototype is a single tone instance of A , the array prop is passed by reference . This means that for each B instance we have access to the same A instance on the prototype . This might sound confusing at first but that 's the magic of prototypes in Quiroscript . This is the caveat of prototypal inheritance . Anything on the prototype will be passed down to each instance . To maintain different instances of the attribute we initialise our object 's attributes in the constructor . When working with objects in JS ( like arrays ) , they are passed by reference . To make use of JS 's prototype system I would suggest something like so : [CODE] This way we reuse the methods from the \" parent \" and have a localised array in our \" child \" . At a first glance this might look as a classic OOP inheritance case but it is a bit different . If you want to read more about prototypes in JS I recommend this article Hope this helps .",

Every row in the UITableView is supposed to have the grey button when the UITableView first loads , and then if a user taps a button then it switches to the red version of the button . For some reason , about 80% of the time when I load the view controller with this UITableView on my iPhone , the first 2 rows in the first section will not have a button . What 's weird is if I tap my finger where the button is supposed to be 2 things happen : The functionality attached to the button works and NSLogs in the console in xcode . The red button appears . So it 's like the grey button is there , it 's just invisible . This does n't work because if a user sees 2 rows without a button they are strideing to think something is broken or that they ca n't tap on that row . Also , if I scroll to the very bottom of my UITableView , and then scroll back up again , the invisible grey buttons will magically appear like they were there the whole time . Here are the first 3 method implementations that are involved in creating my UITableView : [CODE] And then here is my cellForRowAtIndexPath method implementation which does most of the work in creating the UITableView and which actually creates the UIButton settings for each row . The [CODE] statement really has 2 sets of nearly identical code , the only difference is one is for section 1 of the table view and the other is for section 2 : [CODE] I have not included the full method implementations that these 2 statements trigger because they only handle the functionality attached to each button , and most likely have nothing to do with this issue , but I will post them here anyways . These 2 statements can be found in the [CODE] for cellForRowAtIndexPath and handle the touch events for the 2 sections of the table view : [CODE] I see the pattern of trying to set up a custom UITableViewCell from within tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath : quite a lot . The trouble is that I believe it to be the wrong place to do it . If you 're really only using a built-in UITableViewCell , then it 's the right place ; for custom cells , it 's not . I 'd recommend making a UITableViewCell subclass with a \" setup \" method that takes an object and uses that object to set up the cell 's UI . For instance , take section 0 from your UITableView . I 'd do something like this : [CODE] This way , you can set up the cell 's layout as well as images for the button in IB , rather than code . This also makes the code a lot easier to read ( and re-read 6 months later ! ) . Also , unless the 2 cells ( section 0 and section 1) are really interchangeable , I 'd recommend two different subclasses of UITableViewCell to give you greater control , rather than trying to force one to act like the other or vice versa . Then , you simply assign different identifiers and recycle the appropriate type .",

Is there a simpler , more efficient way to write this script to cover multiple load scripts ? Also , should I be using ajax loads to replace the majority of actual links ? Assuming that the id matches the file name the script can be simplified to : [CODE] This script simply specifies each id in a single selector that separates each id with a comma . This will calls the click function to be fired for each element . With the anonymous function attached to the click event , the id of each element is obtained and concatenated to create the file name which is then passed to the load function . If the id does n't always match the element you could use the following approach . [CODE] Here is a suggestion , since the code you posted seems to have a pattern between the id and the filename : [CODE] This suggestion uses .on() and you just need to add a commonParentElementHere , a id or a class of the common parent of those elements . Another option is to use a class on all elements that should be clickable , and then use the code passing the id to the markupx file name , like : [CODE]",
