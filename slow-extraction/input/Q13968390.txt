I am using custom adapter which I use for my ListView . After creating ArrayList [CODE] I have the following code in my app : [CODE] However , when I try to click on the checkbox , nothing happens . So I have to manage toggling checkbox state manually . [CODE] Then it works . ( before that I have to remove setChoiceMode method call ) So what could be the problem ? Why there is no effect ? my R.layout.listview_item_text.xml [CODE] In my adapter I inflate checkbox layout with the following code : [CODE] listview_item_checkbox.xml [CODE] I believe that you have to use a widget that implements Checkable . Try with android.R.layout.simple_list_item_multiple_choice . If you need two lines then implement something similar . Instead of your code : [CODE] Try something like this : [CODE] If you can - improve yur code ( create CheckableFrameLayout as parent layout of your List Item ) . ListView keep BooleanSparseArray of checked positions ( you can get it with method getCheckedItemPositions()) . In code ( grepcode ) it set View checked or not by itself only if View is implementing Checkable . If create CheckableFrameLayout and sat as main parent , you do not have to handle these cases in the adapter .
